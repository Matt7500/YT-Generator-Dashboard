We made our way through the forest. It had been a long time since we had visited this place, but Mira didn't seem to care.

"So much for growing up, huh?" Mira’s voice rang out, sharp and bright as she turned to look at me, a grin stretching across her freckled face. "You’d think a place like this would get smaller after all this time. But nope. Still so... wild."

"Yeah," I said, looking at the forest in front of us. "Still wild."

I could hear the waterfall up ahead. We came around the bend and there it was, just as I remembered it. The waterfall pouring into the gorge, the clear water pooling at the bottom. Many kids had fond memories of this place. Of swimming and spending summers here. I did not. Not after what happened. I found myself staring at the spot near the falls.

The Water Cave.

“You okay?" Mira’s voice snapped me back. I hadn’t realized she’d stopped in her tracks beside me, her hazel eyes studying me with that sisterly mix of amusement and concern. "Don’t tell me this place still spooks you."

I forced a smile. “It doesn’t. I just… I guess it’s just how long it’s been.”

She shrugged. “Good memories?”

“Some of them.”

“Boring,” she said with a chuckle, and started walking along the narrow path following the gorge. “This place was the best. I’ve missed it so much. We’re going swimming later, by the way.”

I didn’t reply. I just stood there for a few seconds gazing down into the basin. I thought about the whirlpool, and about the strange feeling of the water pulling me down. I had tried to forget about it, but the truth was that I never really did. It had left a mark on me. A memory. A feeling.

“Elena!” Mira shouted from ahead. “Hurry up!”

I sighed and started walking again.

The others had already made it to the clearing when we arrived. They were sitting on the rocks by the water, snacking on chips and soda. Greg waved at us as we approached.

“There you are!” he said. “You’re late.”

“We are not,” Mira replied. “I’m not going to let you guys have all the fun without me. What’s in the bag?”

“Just some snacks,” Greg said and threw her a can of soda. “I didn’t eat it all on the way here.”

Luke was sitting with his back turned to us, throwing rocks into the water. “Five skips,” he muttered. “New record.”

Greg put his arm around him and gestured toward the gorge. “Look at this place. It’s much smaller than I remembered it. Or did we just get bigger?”

“Why would we want to take a picture of you?” Mira said and started to take off her shoes and socks, dipping her feet into the water. “You’d just ruin it.”

I didn’t add anything to the conversation. I grabbed the blanket from my backpack and spread it out on the grass. The sound of the waterfall was loud, but instead of giving me peace of mind, it made me feel even more anxious. I looked over at the cave, now submerged by the basin. It was quiet. Too quiet. It didn’t even look like there was an entrance to a cave beneath the calm surface.

“Elena,” Luke said. “Are you okay?”

His voice was soft and serious. It was rare for him to speak like that. The others were laughing at something, but he had noticed my silence.

“Yeah,” I replied. “I just… I don’t know… It’s been so long since we were last here.”

“I understand,” he said with a warm smile.

Mira walked over to me dripping wet. “You’re not allowed to be sad,” she said. “Look at this place. Isn’t it wonderful? And there’s no one else here. We have it all to ourselves.”

She was right. It was beautiful. But something about it felt different now that we were older. It was as though the world around us had changed. I wasn’t sure what it was, but I couldn’t help but feel like something was missing. Or like something was wrong. I turned my attention back to the cave, hoping to find some kind of answer, but there was none to be found.

Mira noticed my gaze. “You’re still afraid of it, aren’t you?”

I looked away. “I’m not afraid.”

“Come on, Elena. It’s just a cave. A stupid, little cave.”

“It’s not stupid,” I said, my voice raised.

She fell silent. I could tell that she wanted to say something, but she didn’t. Instead, she just sat down next to me on the blanket.

“Elena…”

I got up and started walking toward the basin. “I’ll get the sandwiches,” I said.

I tried to ignore the uneasy feeling that had settled in my stomach, but it was hard. It was as if the forest around us was watching me, waiting for something to happen. I shook my head and took a deep breath. This was supposed to be a fun day. A day of nostalgia and laughter. I didn’t want to ruin it with my fears and doubts.



Greg was laughing now, his voice reverberating across the gorge, mixing with the sound of the waterfall. He and Luke were playing in the basin, dragging each other under the water. Mira had left me on the blanket a while ago, excited to join the fun. She was standing on top of a rock now, preparing to make another jump.

“Watch this!” she yelled, and I looked up to see her standing on the edge of a rock, holding her arms out to her sides. She always did this before she made a jump, letting everyone know she was about to do something stupid. It reminded me of the time she had climbed the tallest tree in the forest, just to prove to me she could do it. I had been terrified she would break her neck, but she had been so proud of herself when she made it back down in one piece. This time, however, I wasn't worried about her breaking her neck. I was worried about her drowning. I knew it was irrational, but I couldn't help it. I had almost drowned once, and I didn't want to see Mira suffer the same fate.

She jumped, and I held my breath. She hit the water with a loud splash, and for a moment I thought she had hurt herself. But then I remembered that she was a strong swimmer and would be fine. Still, I couldn't shake the feeling of unease that had settled in my stomach.

I remembered the time I had almost drowned. It had been a few years ago, when I had gone swimming in the same basin with a group of friends. We had been having fun, splashing around and diving off the rocks, when I had felt a strong current pull me down. I had panicked, thrashing around and trying to swim back up to the surface, but it was no use. The current was too strong, and I was being dragged under. I had thought I was going to die, and I had closed my eyes, waiting for the end. But then, just as suddenly as it had started, the current had let go of me, and I had been able to swim to the surface.

I had never gone swimming in the basin again after that. It had scared me too much. But now, watching Mira and Greg and Luke having fun, I couldn't help but feel a little envious. I wished I could join them, but I knew it was too dangerous. The cave was too close, and I didn't want to take any chances.

“Relax,” Greg called from the water, “she's not gonna drown. Mira's, like, part fish or something.”

“Part fish, part chaos,” Luke said, floating on his back with his eyes closed, enjoying the sun on his face.

“It's not funny,” I said, my voice tinged with worry. They didn't hear me, or if they did, they didn't care. They were too busy having fun.

“See?” Mira said, popping up from the water in front of Greg, “I'm fine. I'm not drowning.”

Greg flinched, and then laughed, “You scared me there for a second. I thought you were dead.”

“Please,” Mira said, rolling her eyes, “I'm not that easy to kill. I'm tougher than I look.”

We all laughed, and for a moment, everything felt normal. But then I caught sight of the cave again, and the unease returned.

“Come on, Elena! The water's amazing!” Mira called to me, waving her arms. “Don't just sit there brooding. Get in here and live a little.”

I shook my head, trying to ignore the pull of the cave.

“She's scared of the cold water,” Greg said, teasingly.

“It's not the cold water,” Mira said, splashing him. “It's the cave.” She was trying to make light of it, but I could tell she was just as curious as I was.

Greg looked at me, and then at the cave. “You're scared of it, aren't you?” he said, “It's just a cave. There's nothing to be afraid of.”

I didn't say anything. I didn't want to admit that I was scared, but I couldn't deny it either. The cave had always fascinated me, but it also gave me the creeps. There was something about it that felt... wrong. Like it was hiding something. Something dangerous.

Mira was swimming closer to the cave now, and I felt a surge of panic. “Mira, come back!” I called to her, but she didn't listen. She was too caught up in the excitement of the moment.

“She's fine,” Luke said, trying to reassure me, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was about to go wrong.

Greg was getting out of the water now, shaking himself off like a dog. “I'm getting cold,” he said, “and hungry. Let's go back to the cabin and make some dinner.”

Luke followed him, and they walked up the trail, leaving Mira and me behind.

“You can't keep treating me like a child, Elena,” Mira said, swimming back to where I was sitting on the blanket. “I'm not a kid anymore.”

“I know that,” I said, trying to keep my voice calm.

“Then why won't you let me explore the cave?” she asked, looking at me with a mixture of frustration and curiosity.

“Because it's dangerous,” I said, “and we have no idea what's in there. It could be full of sharp rocks or... or worse.”

“I'm a strong swimmer,” Mira said, “I can handle it.”

“It's not just about swimming,” I said, “it's about the unknown. We don't know what's in there, and until we do, I don't want you going anywhere near it.”

Mira sighed, looking disappointed. “Fine,” she said, “but one day, I'm going to find out what's in there. And when I do, I'm going to prove to you that there's nothing to be afraid of.”

I didn't respond, but I couldn't help but feel a sinking feeling in my stomach. I had a feeling that whatever was in that cave, it was going to change everything.



The sun was beginning to set and the shadows were growing long. The water was a mixture of blue and orange, reflecting the sky above. Mira was wringing out her red hair and lying down on the rocks at the edge, looking satisfied with herself. I was glad she had calmed down, but I still felt uneasy. Greg and Luke had left a little while ago, saying they wanted to go up to the cabin to get some snacks. I had stayed behind to keep Mira company, but now I was regretting it. The gorge felt too quiet, too isolated. I missed the sound of Greg's laughter, the warmth of Luke's presence.

Mira sat up and looked around.

"What's wrong?" I asked, sensing her frustration.

"My sunglasses," she said. "I can't find them."

"Maybe they're in your bag," I suggested.

She shook her head. "No, I think I dropped them in the water when I jumped."

I felt a shiver run down my spine. "Are you sure? Maybe they just fell off the rocks."

"No, I saw something fall when I did that cannonball. I'm pretty sure it was them."

"Mira," I said, trying to keep my voice calm. "Maybe we should just leave them."

She turned to me, her expression defiant. "It's just water, Elena. I'll be fine."

"You don't even know where they landed," I said, following her as she approached the water's edge. "Come on, Mira. They're just sunglasses. Let it go."

"They were expensive," she said, giving me a pointed look. "And besides, it's not like you're offering to dive in and get them for me."

I ignored her jab, focusing on the water. It looked calm on the surface, but I knew better. It was never calm for long.

"Mira," I said, my voice rising. "You promised you wouldn't go near the water again. You said you wouldn't go near the cave."

"I'm not going near the cave," she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "Relax, Elena. I'll stay in the shallow part."

But I could see the way her eyes lingered on the cave, the way she seemed to be drawn to it like a moth to a flame. She was curious, and curiosity was dangerous.

"Mira, don't," I said, my voice pleading. "It's not worth it. Please."

She hesitated for a moment, as if she was considering my words. Then she sighed and said, "I promised I wouldn't go near the cave, and I won't. But come on, it's just for my sunglasses. Relax."

"Relax?" I said, incredulous. "This isn't about sunglasses, and you know it. You're being reckless—again. Stupid things can spiral into dangerous things, Mira. We've seen it happen before."

She looked at me, her expression thoughtful. "You're talking about that whirlpool thing again, aren't you?"

I felt a lump form in my throat. I had never told her the full story, but she had heard bits and pieces over the years. She knew enough to know that it was one of my biggest fears.

"Yeah," I said, my voice barely above a whisper. "The whirlpool. The one that almost pulled me under."

"You were a kid, Elena," she said, her tone dismissive. "You probably misunderstood what was happening. Dad freaked you out, and you blew it up in your head."

"You weren't there," I said, my voice sharp. "You didn't feel it. It wasn't just a current—it was alive, Mira. It wanted me."

She looked at me, her eyes wide with surprise. I had never spoken to her like that before. But I couldn't let her dismiss my fears, not when I knew how real they were.

"You sound like Dad," she said, shaking her head. "Always so paranoid about this place. You know he used to baby you because he thought you were fragile, right?"

"This has nothing to do with Dad!" I snapped, my voice rising. "You don't understand what this place is."

She hesitated for a moment, as if she was going to say something. But then she just shrugged and said, "Fine. I'll stay out of the water."

I felt a sense of relief wash over me, but it was short-lived. Just as I was about to thank her, she added, "I'll just dive into it."

"Mira, no!" I shouted, reaching out to grab her arm.

But she was already moving, stepping onto a rock at the edge of the water. She turned to me, a smile on her face.

"Elena, it's just sunglasses," she said. "I'll be back in one piece, okay?"

And with that, she jumped into the water, disappearing beneath the surface.

I waited, counting the seconds in my head. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. I expected her to come up for air, but she didn't.

"Mira?" I called, my voice echoing off the walls of the gorge. "Mira!"

Still nothing. I felt a growing sense of panic.

And then I saw it.

The water near the cave was moving, swirling in a slow, deliberate circle. It was the same kind of whirlpool that had almost taken me all that time ago. I felt my blood run cold.

"MIRA!" I screamed, getting down on my knees at the water's edge. I reached out, as if I could somehow pull her to safety. "Please," I whispered, tears streaming down my face. "Mira, please."

There was a splash in the water, and for a moment I thought it was her. But it wasn't.

It was her sunglasses, floating on the surface.

She was gone.



I stared at the sunglasses floating on the water as they slowly drifted towards the cave. They looked so out of place there, as if Mira had never worn them. But she had just taken them off a few minutes ago. How could this be?

"Mira!" I shouted, not even realizing I was going to shout it until the word escaped my lips. No response. I leaned closer to the water, holding on to the rocky edge with both hands, but I couldn't see her anywhere. I couldn't see any sign of her.

She wasn't answering.

My breathing became rapid, and my heart raced in my chest. I couldn't believe this was happening. It felt surreal, like a nightmare I couldn't wake up from. I had to jump in and save her. I had to do something.

But the water didn't look right.

"Mira!" I shouted again, louder this time, hoping for any kind of response. But there was nothing, just the sound of the waterfall in the distance. My stomach churned with fear, and I felt a knot forming in my throat.

The ripples around the cave weren't disappearing. They were forming a spiral, slowly spinning and drawing closer to the cave's entrance. I inched towards the edge of the water, my fear and desperation growing stronger with each passing second. I didn't want to get too close, but I had to see her. I had to find her.

"Mira, this isn't funny!" I yelled, my voice shaking with a mix of anger and fear. I tried to convince myself she was playing a prank, but deep down, I knew something was terribly wrong.

The spiral in the water intensified, growing larger and more pronounced. I held my breath, trying to make sense of what I was witnessing. The surface of the water became still for a brief moment, and I could see my reflection staring back at me.

But then, the reflection changed.

It wasn't my face anymore.

The water began to part, slowly and deliberately, as if something was rising from beneath. At first, I thought it was Mira, but as the figure emerged, I realized it wasn't her. It wasn't Mira at all.

It was a woman.

Her skin was pale and bloated, her hair long and dark, floating around her head like a tangle of seaweed. She wore a black dress, the fabric clinging to her body as if it was soaked. But it was her eyes that caught my attention the most—cloudy and lifeless, yet somehow aware.

She stared at me, unblinking, her gaze filled with something I couldn't quite comprehend. Something otherworldly.

A memory flashed before my eyes. A memory of being a child, playing in this very gorge with Mira. The adults had been nearby, but they hadn't been paying attention. I remembered falling into the water, feeling the cold embrace of the current as it pulled me under.

And then... I saw her.

The same woman, floating facedown in the water. I had been too young to understand what it meant at the time, but now it all came rushing back. The adults had pulled us away, whispering amongst themselves, their faces pale with shock and fear.

"She's just sleeping, right?" Mira had asked later that night, her voice filled with innocent curiosity.

But my father's voice had been different. He had explained to me that the woman wasn't sleeping. That she would never wake up again.

And now, here she was, rising from the water before me.

"Stay back," I whispered, my voice barely audible over the rush of the waterfall. I didn't know what else to say or do. I felt paralyzed, trapped in a nightmare that refused to end.

The drowned woman didn't respond. She just floated there, her eyes locked onto mine. Slowly, as if contemplating her next move, she began to rise from the water. Her face broke the surface, water cascading down her cheeks and dripping from her chin.

She opened her mouth, but no words came out. Instead, a strange, gurgling sound escaped her lips—a sound that sent shivers down my spine.

And then, she raised an arm.

The movement was slow and deliberate, as if she hadn't used her limbs in a long time. Her hand emerged from the water, her fingers trembling slightly. She pointed towards the cave, her gaze fixed on me.

"No," I whispered, my voice trembling with fear and disbelief.

The woman's head tilted slightly, her hair clinging to her face. She didn't say anything, but her eyes held a silent command—a demand for me to follow her instructions.

I felt a strange connection to her, as if I could see a part of Mira in her eyes. But it was fleeting, like a mirage in the desert. I couldn't be sure if it was real or just my imagination playing tricks on me.

The spiral in the water continued to grow, drawing my attention back to it. Something was happening beneath the surface, something I couldn't comprehend. It was as if the water itself was alive, responding to the woman's presence.

"I... I can't," I stammered, my voice barely audible. I didn't know what I was agreeing to or refusing, but I knew I couldn't go into that cave. I couldn't follow her.

The drowned woman didn't react. She simply continued to point, her eyes never leaving mine. And then, slowly, she began to sink back into the water.

I watched in horror as she disappeared beneath the surface, her body swallowed by the depths. The spiral in the water remained, but the woman was gone. It was as if she had never been there.

I felt a sense of relief washing over me, but it was short-lived. The fear and confusion lingered, gnawing at the edges of my mind. I didn't know what to do, how to make sense of what had just happened.

And then, I heard it.

A faint splash, coming from the direction of the cave.

My heart skipped a beat, and I turned my head towards the sound. It was distant, but unmistakable.

"Mira?" I called out, my voice filled with a mixture of hope and dread.

There was no response. Just the sound of the waterfall and the eerie silence that followed.

I took a deep breath, trying to steady my nerves. I couldn't leave her. I couldn't abandon her to whatever horrors lurked in that cave.

But as I stood there, on the edge of the water, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was about to make a terrible mistake.



Her sunglasses bobbed up and down once more and then were pulled down into the slow whirlpool near the cave, as if they were being sucked down into the depths. A few seconds passed and I couldn't hear anything except for the sound of my shallow breath and the steady churn of the whirlpool.

And then suddenly Mira's head popped up from beneath the water, not too far from the whirlpool. She splashed up to the surface and let out a loud, "Whooo!" as if she'd just finished a rollercoaster ride. She coughed and laughed, her voice echoing off the walls of the cave.

I felt a wave of relief wash over me and I nearly fell down on my knees. I wanted to cry and scream at the same time. I opened my mouth to shout her name, but all that came out was a croak.

"Mira!" I finally managed to say.

She looked up at me, still treading water. "Elena! You won't believe what I found down there! Hang on, let me catch my breath," she said, panting. "That whirlpool was intense! I thought I was going to get stuck, but I managed to break free. It was a bit disorienting, but I just had to go with the flow. Literally." She chuckled again, wiping water from her eyes.

"You thought you were going to get stuck?" I asked, my voice trembling with fear. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest. "Mira, you could have died!"

"But I didn't!" she replied, brushing off my concern. "Come on, Elena. I've been doing this kind of thing my whole life. You know that." She swam over to the edge of the rock and held up her hand, revealing something shiny. "And look what I found!"

I squinted at her hand, trying to make out what it was. It looked like a piece of jewelry, but I couldn't be sure. "Mira," I said, my voice filled with concern. "What were you thinking? Why did you—"

"Relax," she interrupted, waving her hand dismissively. "It wasn't that big of a deal. You're always so dramatic. Besides, check this out." She tossed the object to me, and I caught it in my hands.

It was a necklace—a beautiful, delicate necklace. It looked like it had been underwater for a long time, but it was still in remarkably good condition. The pendant was shaped like a violin, with intricate designs etched into the metal. I could see tiny, delicate strings on the violin, as if it were a real instrument.

I felt a chill run down my spine. There was something unsettling about the necklace, something that made me uneasy. It was as if I were holding a piece of history in my hands—a piece of history that didn't belong to me.

"What is this?" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

"Treasure," Mira replied with a grin. She climbed out of the water and sat down next to me. "And that's not all." She pulled out another necklace—a simpler one, with three pearls strung together on a silver chain. "This one is even nicer, I think. It's more understated. More elegant."

I looked at the necklaces in my hands, feeling a sense of dread growing inside me. I couldn't shake the feeling that this was wrong, that we were taking something that didn't belong to us. I looked back at the violin pendant, and then it hit me—the memory of the drowned woman. Her face. Her eyes. And this necklace around her neck.

"Mira," I said, my voice trembling. "You shouldn't have taken these."

Mira looked at me, her expression a mix of confusion and amusement. "What? Why not? It's not like anyone was using them."

"You don't understand," I said, my voice growing more urgent.

She glanced at the violin pendant in my hand. "What are you talking about?"

"I've seen this before," I said, almost to myself.

She frowned. "What do you mean? Seen it where?"

I hesitated, my mind racing as I tried to put my thoughts into words. "It—it belonged to her. The woman... I saw her. In the water."

Mira stared at me, then let out a laugh. "Elena, come on. You're not seriously saying this necklace belonged to some ghost or something, are you?"

"It wasn't just a ghost," I said, my voice shaking. "It was... she was watching me. Pointing at me. And this—this was hers. I know it was."

Mira looked at me for a long moment, then shook her head. "That's crazy, Elena," she said, but there was a hint of doubt in her voice. "You must be imagining things. You're always letting your anxiety get the best of you."

I felt a pang of anger at her dismissive tone, but I pushed it aside. "Mira, please," I said, trying to keep my voice calm. "Put it back. It's not right. It's—"

"It'll be fine," she interrupted, reaching for the violin pendant and slipping it around her neck. "This is the coolest thing I've ever found. I'm keeping it. Consider it a souvenir."

I wanted to argue with her, to make her see that this was a mistake, but I couldn't find the words. I just watched as she adjusted the pendant, admiring how it looked on her.

And I couldn't shake the feeling that the drowned woman was still watching us, just beneath the surface, waiting for the right moment to strike.



Mira and I sat beside a fire.  I had a wool blanket wrapped around me that Mira had taken out of her backpack.  I was cold and shivering, but it didn't feel like it was only because of the rain and the wind.  Mira's decision to take the necklaces came as a shock to me, and ever since she had put one of them on – the violin – I had felt a chill in my bones.  I couldn't stop thinking about the necklace and to whom it had belonged.  Mira hadn't listened to my protest but had instead put it around her neck and told me to relax.

Now, sitting across from me, she was playing with it like it was the most natural thing in the world.  Her hair was still wet and she looked a bit unkempt, but it was the kind of unkemptness that only made her more beautiful.  I wanted to tell her to take the necklace off, but I couldn't find the words.  Something was stuck in my throat.

I missed Greg and Luke.  They had left us earlier in the day to return to the cabin, and now there was only Mira and me out here.

"We should leave," I said finally, breaking the brittle quiet between us. My voice came out low and strained, like the words had scraped against something raw on their way out.

Mira chuckled at that, poking the fire with a stick. 

"Leave? Really? After all that? No way."

I took a deep breath, trying not to sound too terrified. I was still shivering, but I wasn't sure if it was due to the cold or my nerves.

"Mira," I said, "that necklace... It belonged to her. I'm sure of it."

She looked at me, giving me an annoyed look, but her eyes were still warm.

"Oh, come on, Elena. There's no ghost, okay? You're just imagining things. I know you're scared, but there's no need to—"

"I saw her!" I shouted, realizing that I was on the verge of crying. I took another deep breath. "She was in the water. And she was pointing at you. At the cave."

Mira let out a sigh, throwing the stick into the fire. 

"This again," she said. "Elena, you're always making things up in your head. Just because you saw a woman in the lake doesn't mean she was a ghost. You were having a panic attack, and you know how that can mess with your mind."

I didn't like it when she spoke to me like that. It was as if she thought of me as a little kid that needed to be coddled. I knew I had a tendency to get anxious about things, but this was different. I had seen the woman in the water, and she had been real. Or, at least, something had been real. 

"It wasn't just my mind," I said. "She was real. And she... She had these eyes, Mira. They were dead, but at the same time, they were alive. It was like she wasn't human anymore."

Mira sat up straight, crossing her legs and looking at me intently. 

"Elena," she said, "you're letting your imagination run wild again. You always do this. You always think the worst is going to happen. And now you're sitting here, wrapped up in a blanket, shivering like a scared little girl. Do you really think that's healthy?"

I looked down at the ground, feeling ashamed. But then I remembered something, something that made my blood run cold.

"Do you remember when we were kids," I said, "and we came to this lake with Dad?"

She didn't answer, but I could tell by the look on her face that she knew what I was talking about.

"We saw a body," I continued. "A woman's body. And she was wearing a necklace just like the one you're wearing now."

Mira's expression changed, but she still didn't say anything.

"She wasn't just a ghost story, Mira. She was real. And she died here, in this lake."

Silence. 

"So what?" Mira said, finally breaking the silence. "People drown in lakes all the time. It's not like it's some kind of curse or anything. You're just letting your fear get the best of you."

"You don't get it," I said, my voice rising. "She was haunting this place even back then! And now you're wearing her necklace like it's some kind of trophy?"

Mira looked at me, her eyes narrowing.

"Elena," she said, her voice low and dangerous, "I'm not going to let you ruin this trip for me. I don't care if you think there's a ghost in that lake, I'm not throwing these necklaces away because of some stupid superstition."

I was about to argue, but then I noticed the necklace again. The pendant was hanging right in front of my face, almost as if it was mocking me.

It was a violin.

I had seen it before, on the woman's neck, and now it was here, hanging from Mira's neck. 

Mira stood up, brushing off some dirt from her pants.

"I'm going to bed," she said, her voice sounding tired. "I'm done with this conversation. You can sleep outside if you want, but I'm going to sleep in the cave. I don't care if you think it's haunted or not."

She walked over to her backpack, picking it up and slinging it over her shoulder.

"I'll see you in the morning," she said, and with that, she disappeared into the darkness.

I sat there, staring at the fire, feeling a mix of fear and anger. I didn't know what to do. Part of me wanted to leave, to get as far away from this place as possible. But another part of me, a part that I didn't want to admit existed, wanted to stay. 

I wanted to find out what was really going on. 

I wanted to confront the ghost. 

And deep down, I wanted to help Mira.



Rewritten Scene:

The fire was slowly dying out, casting shadows across the shore. Mira's breathing was the only sound, deep and even, as she lay in her sleeping bag. I hadn't noticed when she had fallen asleep, but now she was snuggled up next to the fire, her back turned to me. She had taken off the necklace and left it on the ground, saying it was uncomfortable to sleep with. I could see it glimmering in the firelight, its strings reflecting the orange glow.

I don't remember when I closed my eyes, but I must have drifted off. I was so tired. So tired.

I stirred briefly when I heard the faint rustle of movement nearby—Mira. I cracked my eyes open just long enough to see her shape, a blur of shadows against the firelight, as she unzipped her sleeping bag and stood. She muttered something, words too quiet to make out, but the word "water" reached me through the haze of half-sleep. “Mira?” I murmured, my voice sluggish with exhaustion. She didn’t respond, just padded toward the shoreline with unhurried steps. My body protested as I tried to sit up, and the weight of sleep dragged me back down. I told myself I’d follow in a moment, but my eyes slipped closed again.

I awoke to the sound of splashing.

It wasn't distant. It was close.

I sat up straight. The blanket fell off my shoulders. Mira's sleeping bag was empty. She had left it in a hurry, I could still see the imprint of her body in it. I hadn't heard her leave.

"Mira?" I called out, at first almost in a whisper, but then the splash came again and I raised my voice. It was close, very close. Almost as if it had come from right next to us.

"Mira!" I called again and got up on my feet. There was no answer, except for the faint sound of the water.

I went down to the edge of the water. I was still barefoot. I looked out over the lake, expecting to see Mira standing there, but it was empty. I looked over to the other side of the lake, toward the cave, and saw something that made my heart skip a beat.

Ripples.

There were ripples in the water outside the cave.

I looked at the empty sleeping bag again, and then back at the cave. The splashing had stopped, but the ripples were still moving. Mira had clearly been here, I had heard her, but now she was gone. Had she gone over to the cave? But why?

And then a thought hit me. A horrible thought that made me feel sick to my stomach.

What if…?

I turned my eyes toward the cave again. It was so dark inside. I stared at it, and for a second, I thought I saw something move. And then I saw a faint light. It was almost like the light of the moon shining through water, but it was coming from inside the cave.

And then she stepped out of the darkness.

The dead woman stood in the entrance. Her long hair hung in wet tangles across her face. Her eyes were pale and empty, but they seemed to glimmer ever so slightly in the dark. She wasn't entirely invisible, but she was almost see-through. As if she was both there and not there at the same time. But there was no doubt she was looking at me. Her gaze was cold and distant, yet there was a certain sharpness to it.

I shook my head. This couldn't be real. I had to be dreaming.

But I wasn't.

I could feel the cold breeze against my skin. I could feel the earth beneath my feet. I could feel the fear in my heart.

And I could feel the weight of her stare upon me.

I wanted to turn my back to her. I wanted to run away. But I couldn't. Not now. Not while Mira was still missing.

I looked toward the fire. I had to focus on something else. I had to find a way to wake up. I had to find a way to make this nightmare end.

That's when I saw it. The violin necklace. Mira had left it on the ground next to the fire, or maybe she had dropped it there. I didn't know, but as soon as I saw it, I felt a chill run down my spine. I picked it up, not really knowing why, and held it in my hand. It was cold to the touch, but as I squeezed it, I felt a warmth spreading through my body. I didn't know what it meant, but it gave me a strange sense of comfort.

The spirit didn't move. She didn't make any threatening gestures. She just stood there, staring at me.

And then it dawned on me. She wasn't trying to hurt us. She was trying to help us. She was trying to warn us. She was trying to protect us.

"Mira," I said under my breath, and then I ran down to the water.

I jumped in. The cold water hit me like a wall, but I didn't stop. I kept swimming, feeling the necklace in my hand. The further I got, the warmer it got. It was as if it was guiding me, showing me the way.

I swam toward the cave, toward the light. It felt like I was swimming for hours, but I didn't stop. The light was still there, just as strong as before. It didn't go away. It didn't fade. It stayed with me, guiding me.

And then I saw her.

Mira.

She was floating in the water, just outside the cave. Her body was limp, her hair was spread out around her. She looked like she was sleeping. I dove under the water and swam down to her. I could barely see her in the darkness, but the light from the cave illuminated her face. I grabbed her arms and tried to pull her up, but she didn't move. She was stuck. I looked down and saw that her feet were tangled in some underwater roots. I tried to untangle them, but it was difficult. The roots were tight and strong. I pulled and pulled, and finally, they gave away.

I swam back up to the surface with Mira in my arms. I could barely hold on to her, she was so heavy, but I didn't let go. I held her as tight as I could, and I swam back to the shore.

I dragged her out of the water and laid her down on the ground. She wasn't breathing. She was cold and still. I rolled her over on her side and tried to get her to cough up the water, but she didn't respond. I pressed down on her chest, trying to force the water out, but nothing happened. I could feel the tears welling up in my eyes. I couldn't lose her. I couldn't let her die. I pressed down on her chest again, as hard as I could, and finally, I heard a faint gurgling sound. She coughed, and then she gasped for air. She opened her eyes and looked up at me, confused and scared.

"Elena," she said weakly, her voice barely more than a whisper.

I hugged her, holding her close. The necklace was still in my hand, and I felt its warmth against my skin. I looked out at the lake, at the cave, but the light was gone. The spirit was gone.

But I knew she had been there. I knew she had helped me. Saved us.

And I knew that she would always be with me.



I lay on the bank of the river, holding Mira in my arms. My clothes were soaked and it was so cold, but I didn't care. I was just happy to be out of the water. My breathing was shallow, and my throat was burning, but I couldn't rest just yet. Mira's wet hair was glued to her face, and I gently wiped it away. The sky was gray and a faint light was coming over the horizon, but it did nothing to ease the cold winds sweeping through the gorge.

“Mira,” I croaked, shaking her gently. “Please, wake up.”

She was as pale as a ghost and there was a hint of blue on her lips. I lowered my head to watch her chest, desperate to see it rise and fall.

Nothing.

“No.” I shook my head, refusing to believe it.

I started doing chest compressions again. One, two, three. I lost count. I didn't care. I just needed her to breathe again. I tilted her head back, pinched her nose, and gave her mouth-to-mouth. My lips were cold against hers. I continued with the chest compressions, and as I screamed her name at the top of my lungs I started crying.

“Mira! You don't get to do this to me! You don't get to leave me here alone! You don't...”

I couldn't finish the sentence. I bit my lip, trying to stop myself from sobbing, but I couldn't hold it in. I knew what it was like to be alone, and I wouldn't be able to survive it again. Not after everything I had been through. Not after meeting Mira.

I was about to give up. I didn't know how much longer I could keep going. My arms were burning and my throat was raw, but I pushed through the pain. The only thing I could hear was the sound of my own breathing and the thumping of my fist against her chest. There was a faint cough, and then she jerked forward, coughing up water.

I let out a scream of joy, taking a step back. She coughed again, trying to catch her breath, and rolled over to the side. I placed my hand on her back, making sure she didn't fall into the water again. Her eyes opened, and she looked at me with a dazed expression on her face.

“Elena...?”

I couldn't help but laugh, and I wiped the tears from my cheeks. “You're such an idiot,” I said, my voice trembling. “I thought I lost you.”

She coughed again, spitting out more water. She tried to sit up, but she was too weak. “Wha—what happened?”

“Don't,” I said, gently holding her down. “Just rest for a moment. You fell into the water. Do you remember?”

She shook her head, still looking confused. I saw how her eyes wandered to the necklaces on the shore. She brought her hand up to her neck, and then her expression changed. It was a look of confusion and guilt. She had never shown regret for anything she had done before.

“I shouldn't have touched them,” she whispered.

I froze. The Mira I knew wouldn't have said something like that. She would have defended herself. She would have said it wasn't her fault. But this time was different.

“It's okay,” I said, even though I didn't believe it myself. “We're getting rid of them. As soon as we leave.”

“No.” She shook her head. “We're not staying. Not another second.”

“We'll leave as soon as you're ready,” I said, helping her sit up. She was far from strong enough to leave. As soon as I let go of her, she fell back into my arms.

“Don't,” I said, holding her steady. “I'll take care of it. Just rest. You're too weak.”

She didn't protest. She leaned against me, shivering. “I'm so cold,” she said.

“I know,” I said, wrapping a blanket around her. “We'll get you somewhere warm soon.”

She looked at the lake, and I saw her eyes freeze in place. “The cave,” she said. “I—I don't remember why, but I feel like... like something's still there.”

I followed her gaze, but I didn't say anything. I saw the necklaces next to the fire. I had almost forgotten about them. I thought about throwing them into the lake, but I stopped midway. I didn't want to anger whatever had been keeping them there. Instead, I buried them in the mud. It was shallow, but it would have to do.

“We'll leave them here,” I said. “They're not coming with us.”

She seemed relieved to hear that. “Good,” she said. “We shouldn't take them. We can't...”

I didn't know what she was talking about, but I didn't push her. We packed our things, or I did at least. Mira was too weak to get up and help me. She didn't even have the strength to put her things in her backpack. I had to do it all for her.

When I was done packing, I put both of our backpacks on my shoulders and helped Mira to her feet. I took one last look at the lake, and for a brief moment, I saw the ghost of the drowned woman standing in the opening of the cave. She was staring at me, her hair floating around her head. She didn't look angry, but she didn't seem happy either. She just looked... sad.

And then she was gone.

“Elena?” Mira said, her voice weak.

“Let's go,” I said.

We left the gorge, and as we walked through the forest, I silently promised myself never to return to that place.
