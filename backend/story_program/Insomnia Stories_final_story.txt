The hangar bay groaned around me, a low, tortured sound that vibrated through the walls. Oil dripped from broken pipes, forming puddles on the ground where I stood. It smelled of rust and decay. I tried not to breathe too much. It wasn't healthy to breathe too much in here.

I fastened a wrench on a bolt and twisted it, making sure it was tight. The life-support system was a mess. There were entrails and pieces of flesh everywhere, wrapped around the machine like vines. I tried not to look at the parts where I could see the skin, where I could see the fingernails, but it was hard to avoid. It was all mixed together, flesh and metal, and I had to find the spots where I could make the connections. I turned another bolt, adjusting the pressure of the life-support system.

The machine blinked, and I saw a face in there. A reflection? A memory? I didn't know. Then I heard a voice, or more like a scream, echoing in my head. It was faint but distinct. I hesitated for a second.

No. Don't stop. Don't let it get to you.

I forced myself to continue working, even though my hands were shaking. More images flashed before my eyes, more screams and cries of agony. It was as if the machine was trying to communicate with me, to show me what had happened to the people who had been trapped inside it. It was terrifying, but I couldn't let it stop me. I had to focus on the task at hand. I had to fix the life-support system before it was too late.

But then I felt it again. That presence. That feeling of being watched. It was back. It was closer now. I could feel its eyes on me, its breath on my neck. I looked around, but there was nothing there. Just the machine and the darkness.

The light above me flickered, casting shadows on the walls. My heart skipped a beat.

I turned around slowly, trying to listen for any sound, any sign of movement. But all I could hear was the hum of the life-support system and the distant roar of the engines.

And then I heard it.

A faint skittering sound, coming from somewhere behind me.

I froze in place, my heart racing. It was subtle, almost like it was trying to be stealthy. But it wasn't trying to be too stealthy. It was trying to play with me. It was trying to scare me.

I swallowed hard, trying to keep my voice steady.

"Kai," I whispered to myself. "Stay calm."

I turned my attention back to the life-support system. I had to finish the repairs. I had to get it up and running again. But that sound... that thing... was it getting closer?

The skittering stopped. Silence.

"Just stay there," I muttered under my breath, as if it could hear me. As if it would listen. I tried to ignore it, to focus on the task at hand. I leaned in closer to the machine, trying to block out the noise. But it was hard. It was so hard.

A butterfly. That's what I saw. A beautiful, delicate butterfly. I didn't know why it came to mind, or what it meant. It was just a random thought, a distraction. Maybe it was a sign of hope, of something pure and innocent. Or maybe it was just a meaningless hallucination. I didn't know. I didn't care. I just wanted to get out of there.

A loud crash interrupted my thoughts.

I spun around, my heart in my throat. A tool had fallen to the ground, rolling toward the shadows. I watched it, waiting for something to emerge from the darkness. But nothing happened. Nothing moved. Nothing was there.

Or was it?

I squinted, trying to see into the dark corners of the room. I thought I saw something, a flicker of movement. A shadow.

Was it real? Or was it just my imagination playing tricks on me?

I didn't know. But I couldn't shake the feeling that I wasn't alone.

"I know you're there," I said, my voice barely above a whisper. "Show yourself."

The skittering sound returned, louder this time. It was coming from all around me, from everywhere and nowhere. It was like a swarm of rats scurrying through the walls, but more sinister. More menacing.

I backed away slowly, trying to keep my distance from whatever it was. The light flickered again, casting strange, distorted shapes on the walls. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest, my palms sweaty.

And then it stopped.

The life-support system beeped, indicating that the repairs were complete. I let out a sigh of relief, but it was short-lived. I could still hear the skittering, echoing in the back of my mind.

And then I heard a voice.

It was faint, almost like a whisper. But it wasn't coming from the life-support system. It was coming from the darkness. From the shadows.

"You're... wasting... time."

The voice was distorted, as if it was coming from multiple sources at once. It was... unrecognizable, but I understood what it was trying to say. It was mocking me. Taunting me. It knew what I was trying to do, and it was telling me that it was pointless.

I felt a chill run down my spine. I turned to face the darkness, my eyes scanning the room for any sign of movement.

But there was nothing there.



The control room was colder than I remembered.  The air was thin and recycled and felt like it was barely working, as if the ventilation system was on its last legs.  The sound of static filled the room, as well as the endless buzzing of the fluorescent lights.  There were monitors everywhere, each one of them showing something different; diagnostic readings, outside cameras showing the blackness of space, and schematics of the ship.  The monitors were flickering and distorted with static, making them difficult to read.

Jackson was standing in front of one of these monitors, staring at it intently.  I could see his face in the reflection of the screen, his eyes focused and serious.  He didn't look at me as I entered, but I could tell he knew I was there.  Dr. Anna Nair was sitting on the edge of the console, one leg crossed over the other.  She was looking down at the floor, her expression unreadable.  There were two other people in the room, two of the other survivors I assumed, but they were sitting off to the side, staring blankly at the walls and not saying a word.

I walked up to Jackson, my footsteps echoing in the large, empty room.  I still had the wrench in my hand, though I wasn't sure why.  It felt like a safety net, something to hold onto in case things went south.

"Kai," Jackson said, not turning around.  "You're late."

"You noticed."  I wasn't sure why I said that, but it came out a little harsher than I intended.  Jackson didn't react, though.  At least not overtly.  I could see the muscles in his back tense up for a split second, as if he were reminded to breathe.

I leaned against the console, trying to ignore the cold metal against my skin.  It was freezing in here, colder than it should be, and I felt a shiver run down my spine.  I could feel the tension in the air, the weight of the silence.  It was like a thick fog, suffocating and oppressive.

"You know why I called this," Jackson said, his voice low and steady.  He didn't look at me, didn't look at anyone.  He was speaking to the room, to all of us.  To himself, maybe.

Dr. Nair uncrossed her legs, leaning forward slightly.  She was watching Jackson with a strange intensity, her eyes narrowed.

"Calling this feels generous," she said, her voice sharp and cutting.  "You say the word, we all come running like dogs.  Is that protocol now?"  Her lips curled into a half-smile, but it wasn't a friendly one.  It was the smile of someone who knew they were being fucked over and didn't care anymore.

Jackson's eyes hardened, but he didn't rise to the bait.  "Drop it, Anna.  You know what we're fighting.  You know how bad it is now."

"Do I?" she asked, her voice softening.  "You think I don't see what's happening with my own eyes, Jackson?  Or hear it?"

Her voice was calm and measured, but there was an edge to it that made me uneasy.  I didn't say anything, though.  I didn't want to get involved in whatever this was.  Not yet.

"We're losing," Jackson said, his voice cracking slightly.  "If that wasn't clear before, let this be it.  We're... bleeding hours."

I could feel the tension in the room rising, the anger simmering just beneath the surface.  I clenched my fists, trying to keep my emotions in check.  It wasn't easy.

"This ship?  It doesn't belong to us anymore.  We're just..."  He gestured vaguely at the monitors, at the static-filled screens.  "The Somethings— they—own what’s left of this.  We're barely ghosts in their nightmare.  Do you even remember what we’re fighting to save at this point?"

I stood up.  "Don’t start."

He looked at me for the first time, his eyes haunted and empty.  "What?" he said, his voice louder now.  "Don’t start?  I don’t know what to tell you anymore, Kai.  How many of us need to die before you accept this ship deserves to go dark?"

Go dark.

"And what the hell does that even mean, Jackson?  You’re just going to throw us into the Black like it's... what—some mercy?"  I tried to keep my voice low, but it was hard.  I was scared—terrified—and it was showing.  "That's suicide."

"No," he said, his voice softening again.  "That’s the only mercy we have left."

The room went quiet.  Eerily quiet.  I could hear my own heartbeat in my ears, the blood rushing through my veins.

"You’re seriously proposing this?" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.  "You’re giving up?"

Jackson ran a hand through his hair, his eyes distant.  He looked tired, exhausted.  Like he hadn't slept in days.  Maybe he hadn't.

"I’m tired of them screaming," he said finally, his voice barely audible.  "The ones trapped in the walls.  The systems.  They’re already dead, Kai.  We're not saving anyone anymore by pretending to fight."

"And us?" I asked, my voice shaking.  "What about the rest of us, Jackson?  Those... still breathing?"  I could feel tears welling up in my eyes, but I fought them back.  "What happens when we let this ship fall?  You think you’re saving lives?"

He didn't answer.  He just stared at me, his expression unreadable.

I glanced at Dr. Nair, hoping for some kind of support, but she just looked back at me with a cold, empty gaze.  There was no sympathy there, no understanding.  Just... nothing.

"I’m not going into the goddamn void just because you’ve lost hope," I said, my voice trembling with anger and fear.  I wasn't sure if I believed my own words, but I had to try.  I had to hold onto something.

Jackson looked down at the floor, his shoulders slumping.  "You think I haven’t already lost everything?"

The silence was deafening.



The corridors stretched before me, narrow and unkind, like veins coursing through the body of some dying beast. The fluorescent lights above buzzed unevenly, casting faint, greenish halos over warped metal walls. Most of the fixtures flickered erratically, threatening constantly to plunge everything into deeper shadow. My boots crunched over debris—scarred panels torn loose from the ship’s last violent tremor, shards of glass, and remnants of machinery that had outlasted its usefulness. The broken world clattered softly at my every step as I moved toward the sleep pods, the faint sway of the ship’s failing artificial gravity pulling everything just slightly off-center.

I had heard it groaning softly for hours now. The ship. The IAS-7 had always been dying—its death sentence lingering in every mechanical twitch, every unsteady groan—but it felt worse tonight. Compounded. Amplified, maybe, by the heavy silence from the crew. Or perhaps it was the other way around, like the ship’s pain wasn’t just decay, but something alive. Sentient.

I shook the thought off as quickly as it rose. The cold edge of the wrench in my hand grounded me, though the tendons in my wrist throbbed from holding it too long. I transferred the weight to my other hand and flexed my aching fingers. I was pushing uphill tonight—against fear, exhaustion, and the rusting, withering mass of the IAS-7 herself.

The walls creaked behind me. Just expansion from the temperature shift, I told myself for the fifth time. Nothing more.

It wasn’t convincing anymore.

The lights stuttered badly as I turned the next corner. My shadow twisted jaggedly against the jagged walls, contorting in bursts with every shudder of the ship. My throat was raw, either from shouting or the caustic stench that hung in the corridors—I wasn’t sure which. I didn’t take a full breath. You couldn’t, not here. The air tasted like burnt wires and rust.

To my left, a shredded bulkhead gaped open, exposing tangled wires that writhed faintly like severed nerves. I hurried past it. I wasn’t in the mood to see if it was moving or if my mind was twisting shadows into threats again. I wasn’t in the mood for much of anything. Just get to the pod. Close the hatch behind me. Forget.

The whispers started far too softly at first. Little eddies in the crumbling edge of consciousness, like wind slipping through broken glass. Only I knew better. There was no wind here. No air beyond the ship’s thin, recycled supply.

At first, I thought I’d imagined them—just an auditory smear, a nervous tic from too many nights without sleep—but the sound grew. Faintly layered, rising and fading like the ebb of an unnatural tide. Words I couldn’t make out but could almost feel, scraping faintly at the edges of my skull. I stopped walking, wrench raised slightly, scanning the bad lighting and the worse shadows.

Nothing.

A long breath hissed through my clenched teeth as I forced myself to move again. Step. Step. I counted them, shallow and uneven against the debris-laden floor. My pace quickened. I wanted the pod now, more than I could admit.

I almost made it.

The corridor leading to the sleep pods was the worst of them. The walls sagged inward at uneven angles, their metal scorched and puckered from when the fires reached this far. Most of the lights were out, leaving only the weak glow of my handheld torch to show the way. It flickered over the derelict remains—warped pieces of piping, a shattered emergency panel, skeletal frames of some machines that hadn’t been touched since the last attack. And somewhere above it all, the faintest rattle of movement.

I froze. The light from the torch bobbed slightly in synchronization with the rapid jump of my pulse. The sound was subtle—a scrape, maybe, or the shift of material just out of sight. My eyes flickered upward instinctively, staring at the scorched ductwork crisscrossing the ceiling. Nothing moved there, but the dim glow from my torch barely touched the edges of the overhead bulkhead. Too much shadow.

“Don’t,” I whispered to myself, barely an exhale. “Not tonight.”

I should’ve kept walking. I took one hesitant step forward, and the rattle stopped abruptly. The stop was worse than the sound. My skin prickled cold, a shiver rolling from my scalp down the lengths of my arms as I turned my gaze again to the ceiling. At first, there was nothing. Then I saw it.

A drip.

Thick and black, viscous as oil, it hung suspended from an overhead pipe, trembling faintly before falling and splattering onto the wrecked floor. My stomach twisted. Every instinct in me screamed to back away—to run—but my legs didn’t get the message. I stayed rooted, caught between dread and the impossibility of what I knew was coming. A faint hiss rose near my ear. Less sound. More sensation. Static, mechanical, but almost alive. I knew the presence above me before I saw it fully.

The Something emerged from the ceiling with a screech like nothing human. A grotesque, bristling mass of part-shadow, part-flesh, it writhed downward like its shape couldn’t decide what it wanted to be. Churning, gurgling—its surface was studded with fleshy nodules, slickened with glistening black ichor that dripped to the floor. It bled wrong. The dripping fluid hissed sharply as it touched metal, eating hungrily into the warped floor panels. Eyes—no, not eyes, but wrong, darker voids—shifted in and out of its pulsating mass, briefly taking shape before dissolving again into chaos.

I stumbled backward out of instinct, my wrench clattering softly against the corridor wall as it knocked loose from my tightening grip. The sound seemed unthinkably loud. The creature shifted toward me, piece by writhing piece. It didn’t move like it walked, or like it crawled—like dragging shadow from a nightmare rendered physical. Its body stretched unnaturally, curling its churning mass toward me. And at its core: the sound. A deep, guttural chittering, layered with whispers laced like poison. Familiar words folded in there somewhere, but meaningless. I swallowed hard and darted back several more feet. Panic overtook expertise.

My hands fumbled desperately at my belt for the plasma cutter—my only weapon and barely that. The Something’s density shifted, a part of it peeling unnaturally across the adjacent wall, dripping corrupted flesh across the panels. My thumb found the cutter’s ignition more by luck than skill. A frantic burst of weak green plasma flared to life at the end of the tool, flickering against the poor wiring holding the thing together. Not much. Not enough.

The creature surged suddenly, its dripping appendage slamming into the corridor wall beside me. The sheer force rattled the ship’s structure, and the metal where it touched began twisting and blooming—alien textures spreading outward, the skeletal remains of the wall giving way to something organic, porous, alive. I gasped and scrambled aside, swinging the plasma arc desperately, connecting.

The light of the torch seared against the edge of its mass. The creature hissed—no, screamed—and recoiled tightly inward, its surface steaming as if burned. I saw my chance and ran, my legs pushing against every ounce of gravity the ship dared hold steady beneath me.

By the time I reached my pod, I barely remembered how I got there. My hands shook uncontrollably as I slammed the hatch shut and threw the internal lever into place. The faint blue emergency lights inside my pod flickered uneasily, bathing the small enclosure with a pale, hesitantly stable glow. My head hit the molded edge of the wall behind me as I slumped downward. My chest heaved, my breathing shallow and ragged. Shirt soaked. Arms trembling. The wrench and cutter tumbled uselessly out of my hands, clattering against the inside casing of the module. I didn't bother reaching.

Closing my eyes didn’t help. That was almost laughable. Every time they shut, the thing was still there—bristling, wrong, waiting.

I felt the hardened scrap of paper beneath my hand before I realized I’d even reached for it. Thin, brittle—folded neatly until I’d creased it to useless ruin over years of worry and retreat. The butterfly I’d once drawn stared faintly back at me in imperfect lines and faded graphite. It looked fragile in the flickering lights, more like a dream than memory—more like nothing.

I held onto it anyway and let the world go dark around me.



I woke up feeling cold. There was a bad taste in my mouth and my heart was beating out of rhythm with the low rumbling of the ship, but other than that, there was nothing out of the ordinary. I still had the piece of paper in my hand. I let go of it the second I noticed it. I could tell that something was wrong, but I couldn't put my finger on what it was.

Then the alarms went off.

A loud mechanical noise startled me, causing me to sit up straight and hit my head against the top of the pod. I took a deep breath. Adrenaline pumped through my body.

Alarms could mean one of two things: one, something had gotten in, or two, something was about to get in. I prayed it was the latter.

The light inside the pod flashed red. The voice of the announcement system followed as a loud crackling noise:

“Shield output compromised. Reactor systems at 23 percent. Maintenance override required. Repeat—shield output compromised.”

Maintenance override—my job. I didn't have time to think about what those words meant as I pulled myself up and reached for the panel on the wall.

I pressed a button to open the hatch and stumbled out of the pod, almost losing my balance. The air outside was cold and dry, and breathing it in made me feel like I was about to throw up.

I picked up the wrench from the floor and ran toward the maintenance console. My legs felt heavy, as if they hadn't woken up yet. A loud, metallic groaning sound could be heard from somewhere deep inside the ship.

I didn't stop.

I reached the maintenance console and noticed how it was flashing with red lights. It had been there since forever, and just like everything else on the ship, it had been badly taken care of. But unlike most of the other systems, it had been kept alive with life support—my life support.

I put my hand on the console to keep my balance, looking at the emergency shutdown codes that were displayed on the screen in front of me. I typed them in as quickly as I could and watched as the static-riddled schematics updated themselves. The text was a complete mess, but I was able to make out the most important parts of it.

Reactor systems stabilizing. External shielding still below threshold. Hull integrity at 62 percent.

It wasn't good, but it was the best I could do.

I adjusted the settings to optimize the power output and tried to figure out what was causing the external shielding to fail. Was it an enemy attack? I looked at the external cameras, but there was nothing out there—just the empty void of space.

And then it happened.

A loud, shrill sound came from the console, interrupting the alarms and the announcements. I cursed under my breath, trying to figure out what the hell was going on. The console was picking up some kind of signal, but it was too distorted to make out.

I adjusted the settings and listened carefully. And that's when I heard it—a voice, barely audible over the static:

“—IAS-7... Can anyone hear me? Please respond.”

I froze. The signal was too weak to make out what the person was saying, but it was clear that someone was trying to communicate with me.

“This is the Dreamer,” the voice came again, clearer this time. “We’ve been... breached. Someone... Please...” The transmission hissed and crackled. "This ship is not surviving."

I froze. That voice wasn't coming from someone random. It was Anna. I felt an uncomfortable, uneasy sensation hearing her voice. It dredged up memories of that woman, memories of her hazel eyes, of how she had lied to me, of how she had evaded my questions. It was her. It was Anna. She was here.

I didn't even realize I had picked up the comm and was holding it to my mouth. My voice was shaky and filled with emotion, but I tried to make it sound cold and threatening.

“You're transmitting on an unauthorized frequency. State your location.”

“Kai,” she said, and I heard her voice clearly now on the other end of the line. “Oh my God, Kai, is that you?”

“Yeah, it's me. Now tell me where you are.”

“We need a docking clearance. The Dreamer... it has already breached many of the decks. Everyone is... everyone is dead. We're the only ones left. Your ship is the only place we can dock. Please. I'm sending you my coordinates.”

I looked at the console, at the incoming transmission. There it was, a small signal coming from outside the range of the ship's radar. It had to be them. But why hadn't they been detected until now? Could it be that the sensor array had gone offline just as they had approached? Or... were the Somethings jamming the signal? I didn't have time to think about it. If they were close enough to dock the ship, it meant they were only a couple of kilometers away.

This had to be a trap. But what if it wasn't?

“Why now?” I asked. “How can I know you haven't been compromised? If you're still alive—”

“I wouldn't have contacted you unless I had no other choice,” she said, interrupting me. “You know me, Kai. You know this isn't a trick.”

“But do I?” I said.

There was a silence. I considered ending the transmission then and there, but I hesitated.

“If you don't let us dock,” she said, “then I guarantee you, whatever killed us will come for you next. You won't be able to escape. There's no way out if we don't make it. And that's not a threat. It's a plea.”

I didn't respond.

Without thinking, I unlocked the docking codes and sent them to the incoming transmission. Then I ended the communication. They were on their way.

I was about to leave the console when I noticed something in the corner of my eye. A presence. It was just for a split second, but I could have sworn... I turned around and held up the wrench.

No one was there.



The Dreamer docked with the IAS-7 like a corpse slumping against the door. I could feel the vibration through the ship, a low tremor extending from the engagement of the airlock seals. My arms tensed up instinctively, my fingers tightening around the wrench. Even here, by the airlock, I could see the texture of the Something intermingling with the walls—bulging, fibrous patterns that stretched out like unnatural growths. They seemed to pulse in time with the docking procedure.

I stayed in the corridor, waiting for the airlock hatch to open. When it did, it groaned as if it was in pain, and I held my breath. I reached for the cutter at my belt, ready to ignite it at a moment's notice, although I told myself it was just a precaution.

The inner door opened first, letting cold air from the other side flood the corridor. There was a metallic stench in it that made me wrinkle my nose. Then, the outer lock hissed open, and she stepped inside.

Anna.

She looked ragged and disheveled, her jumpsuit torn and dirty, her face pale and gaunt. Her boots scraped against the metal grating as she crossed the threshold. She stood there for a moment, framed by the red emergency light above the airlock. She looked human. Tired and haunted, but human.

"God," she said, her voice barely more than a whisper. She took a deep breath, as if she was trying to convince herself of something. "I didn't... I wasn't sure this was real. I thought maybe—"

"Step forward," I interrupted, my voice harsher than I intended. I didn't lower the wrench. "One step. Hands up."

She hesitated, her eyes flicking to mine. There was something in them, something that made me doubt her. But she raised her hands—slowly, cautiously—and took a single step forward.

"It's me, Kai," she said. "I'm not... Please. It's me."

She sounded like Anna. Almost exactly. But I knew better than to trust my ears. I lowered the wrench a little, still keeping my distance.

"Prove it," I said. "How do I know you're not... one of them?"

She sighed, her shoulders slumping. She looked tired, so tired. 

"How do I prove something like that?" she asked, her voice laced with frustration. "What do you want, Kai? A blood sample? A confession? You know this thing we're fighting doesn't work like that."

"That's my point," I said, but my grip on the wrench loosened a little. "You could be—contaminated. I don't know. I've seen it happen before."

"I'm not," she said, a hint of desperation in her voice. "I'm still me. I'm still here."

I didn't know if I believed her, but I wanted to. God, I wanted to. I looked at her, searching for any signs of deception, any cracks in her facade. But all I saw was a woman who had been through hell and back. A woman who looked like Anna.

"What happened on the Dreamer?" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady. I needed to know what I was dealing with.

She lowered her hands slowly, taking a deep breath before speaking. There was a haunted look in her eyes, a look that made my heart ache.

"It started in the lower decks," she said, her voice trembling slightly. "At first, it was just... small things. Equipment malfunctions. Power fluctuations. But then it got worse. Much worse."

"How bad?" I asked.

"Everyone's gone," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "Everyone. It was like a plague, spreading through the ship. One minute they were themselves, and the next... they weren't. I tried to stop it, tried to contain it, but it was too late. There was nothing I could do."

She fell silent, and I didn't press her for more details. I could only imagine the horror she had witnessed. The same horror I had seen, only on a much larger scale.

"You got away," I said, more as a statement than a question. It was the only logical conclusion, yet something felt off about it. "You managed to escape."

She nodded, a bitter smile playing on her lips. "Barely. I fought my way through hell to get here. I thought... I thought maybe I could find help. Maybe I could still stop it."

I wanted to believe her. I wanted to trust her. But there was a nagging doubt in the back of my mind, a doubt that refused to go away. I couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong.

"So?" she said, her voice softening. "Are you going to trust me, Kai? Or are we going to keep playing this game?"

I hesitated, my mind racing. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know who to trust. But I knew one thing: I couldn't let Jackson sever the connection to the Dreamer. If he did, we would be trapped here, with no way to escape.

"We need to stop Jackson," I said, making up my mind. "He's going to cut the connection to the Dreamer. If he does that, we're screwed."

Anna nodded, a determined look in her eyes. "Then let's go," she said. "We have to stop him before it's too late."

I turned to lead the way, but before I could take a step, Anna called out to me.

"Kai," she said, her voice filled with a strange urgency. "There's something else. Something important."

I turned back to face her, my curiosity piqued. "What is it?" I asked.

She hesitated for a moment, as if unsure of how to say what she wanted to say. Then, she reached for something in her pocket.

"This," she said, holding up a small, folded piece of paper. "I found this on the Dreamer. I don't know what it means, but I thought you should see it."

I took the paper from her, unfolding it carefully. Inside, there was a drawing of a butterfly.



I kept the drawing in my pocket as we made our way deeper into the IAS-7 with Anna. She didn't ask about it again, but her comment stayed with me. It planted a seed in my mind, one that I didn't want to grow but that I couldn't help watering. The ship filled the silence with its strange and alien sounds, and it felt like it was breathing. It drowned out the sound of my own breathing.

The corridor was long, narrower the further away from the docking shaft we got. I could still feel the Dreamer's docking in the floor, like a faint vibration in my feet. It was cold. Much colder than it should have been. The air itself was icy. The Somethings had left their mark all over the place. I could see small, pulsating, fibrous growths on the walls, and a thin layer of liquid had formed in certain places. The walls were bent in ways that seemed wrong, and it almost sounded like they were exhaling.

I tightened my grip around the wrench. It was a comforting feeling, having it in my hand.

That's when I heard it.

A song.

It was barely audible, but it was there. It was dissonant in a way that I couldn't quite put my finger on. It didn't sound like the IAS-7. It didn't sound like anything. I stopped in my tracks and reached out my hand to stop Anna. She froze immediately. Her eyes met mine.

"Do you hear that?" I asked.

She hesitated for a second, then she nodded. "I've heard it ever since we boarded the Dreamer," she said. "It got more intense when they arrived."

The Somethings. Of course. I looked around, trying to figure out where the song came from. It was hard to pinpoint. It felt like it was coming from everywhere at once. I could feel it in the floor. It made my stomach turn. I felt like I was going to throw up but managed to keep it down.

"It's close," I said. "And it's watching."

Anna's face hardened. I could see a hint of doubt behind her eyes, but she did a good job hiding it. She scanned the bulkheads for a second, then she turned back to me.

"Let's keep going," she said. "We can't let Jackson do this."

I nodded. I knew she was right. If Jackson followed through with his plan, this place would become a grave. And there would be no one left to bury.

We continued down the corridor. The song grew louder. It was a horrible sound, like something scraping against my skull. My heart raced. I could hear my own heartbeat, almost in tune with the song. It felt like it was inside my head, tearing me apart from the inside. I knew that it was them. It was the Somethings.

They were close.

I could see them in the corners of my eyes, but whenever I turned my head, they disappeared. They were just out of reach, lurking in the shadows. I didn't know if they were taunting us or if they were afraid of us. Maybe they just wanted to see what we would do. I couldn't tell. I didn't care. I just wanted to get the hell out of there.

I thought I saw one of the Somethings, but it was hard to tell. It was just a glimpse. A shadow. Maybe it was just my imagination. Every now and then, I thought I saw a limb or a tentacle or something else that didn't belong, but it was always gone before I could get a good look at it. I tried to ignore it. I tried to convince myself that we were faster than them. Or smarter. Or at least more desperate.

Anna was breathing heavily next to me, but she didn't slow down. I could see the fear in her eyes. She was trying to hide it, but it was there. It wasn't just fear. It was something else. Something I couldn't put into words. I wanted to ask her if she was okay, but I didn't.

The air grew thicker as we got closer to the core. It was harder to breathe. The walls were closing in on us. I felt like I was walking through a tunnel, but the walls were made of flesh and bone. My footsteps echoed in the corridor, and the song grew louder. It was inside the walls. Inside the ship. Inside me.

We turned a corner, and I saw something that made my blood run cold.

It was a person. Or at least, it used to be. They were fused with the metal of the bulkhead, their body twisted and contorted. Their skin was stretched over the metal like a second layer, and I could see wires and tubes running through their flesh. Black ooze was seeping from their pores, and their clothes were torn and stained. Their head was hanging low, but as we approached, they lifted it up. I heard the crack of their neck as it snapped back into place.

One of their eyes was human. The other was a black void, a swirling mass of darkness.

"Don't—" they said. Their voice was rasping, like they were choking on their own blood. "Don't go closer. Don't—please."

I stopped. Anna stopped next to me. The song grew louder, more intense, as if it was trying to drown out the person's voice. Or maybe it was trying to warn us. I didn't know. I couldn't think straight. I felt a wave of nausea wash over me, and I gripped the wrench tighter.

"Don't go there," the person said. "It... doesn't end. It doesn't let go."

They coughed up a black liquid, and I realized they weren't coughing. They were crying. A desperate sob escaped their lips.

"Turn back," they said. "It'll—take you too."

I felt Anna's eyes on me. I could feel her hesitation, her doubt. She didn't want to leave them behind. Neither did I. But I knew we had no choice. We couldn't save them. We couldn't save anyone. Not here. Not now.

"They're gone," Anna said. "The person—they're not... they're not them anymore."

I didn't answer. I couldn't. I didn't know what to say. I just stared at the person, at the thing, at the monster. I couldn't look away.

"We have to go," Anna said. Her voice was firm, but I could hear the uncertainty in it. "We have to stop this."

I nodded, but I didn't move. I couldn't. I was frozen in place, like I was rooted to the ground. I wanted to help them. I wanted to do something. But I didn't know what. I didn't know how.

Anna took a step closer to me. She placed a hand on my shoulder. Her touch was gentle, but it was enough to snap me out of it. I looked at her, and I saw the determination in her eyes. She was scared, but she wasn't going to let it stop her. She wasn't going to let it stop us.

"Come on," she said.

I nodded again, and this time I forced myself to move. I took a step forward, and then another. The person watched us, their eyes filled with despair. I tried not to look at them, but it was impossible. Their gaze was fixed on me, on us, on everything. They were pleading with us, begging us to stay. But we couldn't. We couldn't stay. We had to go. We had to finish this.

Anna and I continued down the corridor. The song was still there, still growing louder. It was inside my head, inside my soul. It was all around us. I tried to ignore it, but it was impossible. It was like a part of me now. Like a virus that had infected my mind.

We kept walking.



The door to the power core lay ahead, the outline of it blurred and jagged as if the air itself was rotting. I'd been breathing in something noxious for a while now, I realized, and it was making my lungs feel heavy and my breaths labored. I tried to ignore it, thinking of the way the song had gotten louder, more insistent, more angry. The ship was dying - succumbing to an infection that was slowly overtaking the entire IAS-7. We had to stop it before it was too late.

I still wasn't sure if it was too late, but I knew one thing. If the ship died, we were all dead, too.

"Stay close," I said to Anna, hearing my voice echo back to me a second later as if bouncing off a distant wall. I didn't turn back to look at her, just kept moving forward. I could hear her footsteps behind mine, following me. She was stepping in rhythm with me - so perfectly in time that it was difficult to tell which footsteps were mine and which were hers.

I didn't let that bother me. I just kept moving toward the power core.

The door shuddered as I reached it, and I put my hand up to the control panel, feeling a static shock as I did so. It felt like the electricity was trying to tear my hand back, to keep me from opening the door, but I pressed it until the door opened.

Inside, there was a tangle of wires that led up to the ceiling, and I realized the casing was missing. The power core had been torn open, exposing the guts of it. Black oil dripped from the conduits of metal which had been bent at odd angles and torn open. The walls were covered in a glossy, wet substance that pulsated and moved like it was alive.

And Jackson was standing in the center of it all.

At first I didn't even recognize him. He was so much a part of the mess of wires and cables and black ooze, that he blended into it. But then I saw his face - or at least what was left of it.

His eyes were hazel. Well, one of them was. The other had been consumed by blackness, and a hole was leaking more of that black ooze, tendrils of it plugging into the cables surrounding him. The rest of his face was a patchwork of lesions and what appeared to be metal pieces poking through his skin. His mouth was twisted and too wide, like he was trying to smile but had forgotten how.

He turned to look at me, and his gaze locked on mine. I wanted to call out his name, but something told me it wouldn't do any good. He was too far gone. Whatever had done this to him, it had taken him over completely.

"Kai..." he said, his voice a hoarse whisper that grated on my ears like nails on a chalkboard. "You shouldn't have..."

He coughed, and black ooze sprayed from his mouth, hissing as it hit the floor. He doubled over, his body shaking with convulsions, but then straightened up again with a sickening snap.

"You shouldn't have come."

I took a step forward, trying to keep my distance but also trying to get closer to him. I still had the wrench in my hand, but it felt heavy and useless.

"Jackson," I said, trying to sound calm and rational. "What are you doing? We can help you, we can fix this."

He laughed, a wet, gurgling sound that made my skin crawl. His head jerked to the side, as if he was trying to get a better look at me, and I saw that his eyes were filled with a mix of sadness and anger.

"Fix this?" he said, his voice rising to a fever pitch. "There is no fixing this, Kai. This is...this is something you can't even begin to understand."

He slammed his hand against the nearest bundle of wires, and they pulsed with energy, sending a shockwave through the room.

"You think you can stop this?" he shouted, his voice echoing off the walls. "You think you can just walk in here and make it all go away?"

I took another step forward, my grip tightening on the wrench. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest, and I knew that I was in way over my head.

"We've survived this long," I said, trying to sound confident. "We'll find a way to beat this, but not if you keep fighting us."

Jackson's face contorted into a sneer, and for a moment I thought he was going to attack me. But then he just laughed again, a hollow, bitter sound.

"It's too late," he said. "Too late for me, too late for you, too late for all of us."

And then he lunged at me.

I barely had time to react. One moment he was standing in front of me, and the next he was on top of me, his claws digging into my shoulder. I fell back, hitting the grate hard, and the air was knocked out of me.

I fought back, swinging the wrench into his side, but it was like hitting a brick wall. He didn't even flinch. He just kept coming at me, his face twisted into a snarl.

As I struggled to free myself, I saw his body changing. His skin was bubbling and boiling, and tendrils were sprouting from his back. They wrapped around my arm, and I screamed, trying to shake them off.

I reached for the cutter on my belt, activating it with a flick of my wrist. The blade hissed to life, and I swung it at the tendrils, severing them with a shower of sparks. But more kept coming, and I could feel them tightening around my throat.

I heard Jackson's voice in my ear, but it wasn't just his voice. There were others mixed in, voices that didn't belong, voices that shouldn't have been there. They were all talking at once, a cacophony of noise that made my head spin.

And then, just as suddenly as it had started, it stopped.

I looked up, and saw Anna standing over us. She had a look of determination on her face, and I thought she was going to help me. But then I saw her eyes, and I realized that something was wrong.

Her eyes were glowing, a deep, unnatural red. And her mouth was twisted into a cruel smile.

"Anna?" I said, my voice trembling. "What are you doing?"

She didn't answer. She just reached down, her hands wrapping around Jackson's neck, and lifted him off of me with a strength that seemed impossible.

I scrambled to my feet, backing away from the two of them. I wanted to help, but I didn't know how. I didn't know what was going on.

Anna held Jackson in the air, her grip tightening as he struggled. He was trying to break free, but it was like he was fighting against an invisible force.

And then, with a sudden burst of energy, Anna threw him across the room. He hit the wall with a sickening thud, and I heard a crack as his skull hit the metal.

He didn't get up.

I watched in horror as Anna approached him, her eyes still glowing. And then, as if in a trance, she knelt down beside him and began to tear at his flesh.

I wanted to look away, but I couldn't. It was like a car crash, something so terrible that you couldn't help but watch.

Anna was ripping Jackson apart, tearing chunks of flesh from his body and devouring them. Her mouth was filled with blood, and her eyes were wild with hunger.

I felt bile rising in my throat, and I turned away, trying to block out the sound of her gnawing and chewing.

I didn't know how long it went on for, but when I finally turned back, Jackson was gone.

Anna was standing over a pile of bones and gore, her face stained with blood. She looked at me, and I saw a flicker of recognition in her eyes.

For a moment, I thought she was going to attack me too. But then she just turned away, as if I wasn't even there, and walked out of the room.

I was left standing there, alone, surrounded by the remnants of Jackson's body.

I didn't know what to do, but I knew that I couldn't stay there. I had to get out, had to find a way to stop whatever was happening.

But as I turned to leave, I heard a voice behind me. It was Anna's voice, but it was different now. It was cold and mechanical, and it sent a shiver down my spine.

"You should have listened," she said. "You should have listened to the song."

I didn't turn around. I just kept walking, trying to ignore the sound of her voice.

But it followed me, echoing in my head like a haunting melody.

And as I made my way through the darkness, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched. That something was lurking in the shadows, waiting for the right moment to strike.

I had a sinking feeling that I wasn't going to make it out of there alive.



Her shadow stretched out in front of me, impossibly tall, the song reverberating in my ears, in my skull, behind my eyes, in my bones.  Her eyes burned into mine and for a moment I could think of nothing but the inevitability of what she said.

"You should never have trusted me."

The shock had temporarily paralyzed me. I could barely breathe, my heart pounding with panic. I still had the cutter in my hand, but I didn't lift it. There was no point. Anna was gone. I was looking at something else, something that shouldn't exist. I had the feeling that I was staring at the end of everything.

The world turned on itself, like molten metal folding in on itself. The walls of the core were pulsing, moving like a faintly breathing lung. The smell of burnt electronics and black sludge filled my nostrils, making me gag and vomit in my mouth. I swallowed it, desperately trying to keep my head clear. To stay grounded. To stay alive.

And then I heard it.

Something was dragging itself toward me from behind. Something metallic scraping against the floor. It was moving slowly, accompanied by frequent pauses, almost as if it was struggling to keep going. I didn't dare to take my gaze off Anna. I couldn't. But the sound of that thing slowly made its way toward me was impossible to ignore.

Finally, it reached me.

I felt something bump against my leg. Something wet and heavy. I didn't want to look down, but it was impossible not to.

It was a hand. No, it was Jackson's hand.

Both of them.

They were blackened and burned at the wrists, but somehow they were still alive. The fingers moved, twitching slightly. And they were holding something. A notebook. It was covered in blood and entrails, but I could still make out Jackson's name on the cover.

"What the hell..." The words trembled out before I could stop them, barely audible over the oppressive hum of the song.

The hands shuffled closer and closer to me. It was as if they wanted me to take the notebook from them. I couldn't imagine how that could be the case, though, and yet it sure seemed that way. I couldn't scream, but if I could have I would have.

Anna didn't move. She just stood there, looking at me, as if I were being tested. Her eyes ever so slightly glanced down at the hands, then returned to me. She was watching me.

I didn't want to take that notebook. It couldn't have been Jackson who wanted to give it to me, even though it looked like it. But then why would those hands be trying to give it to me? It didn't make any sense. I moved back a little, but the hands kept pushing the notebook toward me until it was pressed up against my knee.

I took it.

I took it because I couldn't stand the thought of being approached by something that wanted to give me something, and then refusing to accept it. It's hard to explain why. But there was something so human about that gesture, even though it came from something I couldn't fathom as anything other than a monster. There was something about it that reminded me of Jackson, although I couldn't say what it was. I was curious. Curious to see what it wanted to show me. Jackson had once promised me to show me a butterfly. I don't know why I thought about that right there and then. I couldn't imagine that this was it, but I was curious nonetheless. I wanted to know. I wanted to understand. I wanted to know what was going on in that mind of his, if there was anything left of it at all.

I opened the notebook. It was soaked in some kind of liquid, making the pages stick together. I ripped them apart, and on each page, I saw a bunch of notes written by Jackson. Some of them had been crossed over completely, rendering them unreadable. I flipped through the pages, faster and faster, until I found what I was looking for.

It was a drawing. A drawing of a butterfly.

"I’ll draw you something," he’d said, his gruff voice tinged with uncharacteristic gentleness. "Something... better than this. You’ll see."

I hadn't believed him.

I'd forgotten.

But here it was.

And now, I understood.

I don't know how to explain the sensation that came over me, but it was as if every breath I took was being torn from my chest, like breathing in sharp, broken glass. This wasn't a way out. It wasn't a dream to escape the sinking ship of this universe. It wasn't a way to flee the rot, the decay.

It was a way to embrace it.

The butterfly wasn't a rejection of the decay—it was a metamorphosis. The universe, the IAS-7, us—we weren't meant to survive the decay. We were meant to become it. Jackson knew that. He'd tried to stop it, to fight against it. But in the end, he realized that the decay wasn't the end.

It was a new beginning.

And this was his last gift to me. In  all of this chaos, he'd given me something I didn't even know I wanted. A choice.

Do I fight it? Do I try to hold on to who I am? Or do I let it change me? Do I let it turn me into something new, something that it can't destroy?

A guttural sound broke my train of thought.

Anna.

She lunged at me.

I stumbled backward, clutching the notebook to my chest. Her tendrils lashed out at me, like the claws of that terrible song, and I barely managed to duck out of the way before she slammed into the grating where I'd been standing a moment before.

There was a part of me that knew I wasn't going to escape. Not like this. Not... human.

But maybe that wasn't the point.

The butterfly embedded itself into my mind, and I held the notebook tighter in my hands.

"I won't end like you!" I screamed at her—or at myself. Maybe both.

Her body contorted, her face not showing any emotions but her eyes now fully black and reflecting the rhythm of the song. Her presence was overpowering, her shadow casting over me. Still, I held the notebook tight against my chest and took a step toward her. Toward her…



The shadow of Anna's presence weighed down on me, making the room feel much larger than it was. The song was getting into my head, twisting everything around me. It was hard to even stand up straight, and the longer I listened to it the weaker I felt.

I backed away and looked down at the notebook again. The butterfly stared back at me, its wings uneven and poorly drawn. I didn't know what to do. There had to be something. The wires. It had to mean something. Jackson had to have had a plan. I just couldn't figure out what it might have been.

The shadow of Anna turned her face toward me. Her eyes were bottomless pits of darkness. Her tendrils lashed out from behind her, cutting through the floor grating like it was made out of paper.

"Kai," her voice came—a distorted amalgamation of tones, layered and wrong. It wasn’t Anna’s voice anymore; it was something vast and hollow, a sound like splintered glass scraping across the remnants of my sanity. "You can’t escape it. You are it."

I took a deep breath. It was difficult, but I managed. Then I glanced up at the node again. The wires coming out from it. It was pulsating with the same unhealthy rhythm as the rest of the ship. This was the connection to it. This was the cord that tied us to whatever was out there.

“No,” I said. My voice was hoarse from all the screaming, but I managed to speak. “I won't let you do this to me.”

She tilted her head, the motion slow and unnerving, like a marionette under frayed strings. Her lips curled back—no, stretched—into something too wide, too knowing. "Oh, Kai... you still think there’s an ending?"

I didn't respond.  I couldn't.  I was already running toward the wires, wrench still in one hand, notebook in the other.  The butterfly didn't move.  Still it held on, as if waiting to see what I would do.

She screamed as if she knew what I was planning.  The noise was so loud it made my ears ring and I nearly lost my balance as a tentacle lashed out at me.

I dove forward and hit the grating just in time to avoid the thing as it severed the air where my chest had been a split second before.  I scrambled forward on my hands and knees and reached the wires.  Grabbing hold of them, I pulled them out, trying to find the one that was the source of the corruption.

The ship began to shake violently, and I could feel the Somethings were coming.  I could feel their heat, their presence - but I couldn't see them yet.

Another tentacle went for me, this one hitting me on the arm, cutting deep into the wound I already had.  I screamed in agony and held up the cutter in my free hand, the blade alighting with blue energy.  The white hot line of burning plasma severed the tentacle and it screamed in pain, the black liquid pouring from it, sizzling on the floor beside me.

“You’ll kill them all!” Anna’s voice rang out, the tones vibrating against my skull. "The crew—the hope—what little you’ve held onto. You can’t fight the song by silencing it!"

Her words cut deep; they struck at my insecurities. What if there was nothing left? What if I was killing the last remnants of life? I hesitated for a second before grabbing the first set of cables.

But then I heard a voice. It was a weak, flickering voice. It wasn't Anna, and it wasn't the Somethings. Maybe it was Jackson's, or what was left of him. Or maybe it was just my mind playing tricks on me. But it didn't sound angry. It didn't sound cruel.

"Don't stop now."

I took a deep breath, stood up, and smashed the spanner against the first wire with all the strength I could muster. Sparks flew in every direction, burning my skin, and the room lit up as if a fire had been ignited. The ship shook, and the song stopped for a second before it continued just as before. But I could hear the Somethings screaming in the distance.

Anna – or whatever she was – screamed in agony and her body deformed into something new as she leapt at me, reaching out with her long arms.

“NO!” she screamed, her voice layered with a thousand other voices. "Do you think the Black will save you? It will consume you! It will make you nothing!"

I didn't listen. I tried to remove another set of cables. I didn't have much strength left, so it took me a while to rip them apart, but when I finally succeeded, the light from the core dimmed even more. 

The Somethings entered the room. They poured in through the door, crawling and creeping like a black liquid, and their screeches filled my ears. But they, too, faltered, just like the ship did, when the connection to… to whatever, was disrupted. They vanished and appeared, vanished and appeared. 

One more. Just one more. 

I reached for the main cable. Anna's corpse—no, the thing inside Anna's corpse—screamed and leaped at me. Her body unraveled, and her head melted into a writhing mass of tendrils. She was still beautiful. I couldn't help but think that. Even now. She was still beautiful. 

But it was too late.

I grabbed the main cable and pulled. 

The cable snapped loose, and the room was filled with light, not just a white light, but a red and black one too. The song disappeared, leaving only the sound of silence. Then, a moment later, the Somethings screeched one last time before they vanished completely, as if swallowed by the same void that had swallowed the IAS-7. 

I fell to the floor. 

The notebook slipped out of my hand and landed on the ground, opening up to a page of the butterfly. I sat on my knees, breathing heavily, feeling the vibrations of the ship fade away under me, slowly, slowly—until it was gone. 

The silence was deafening. 

The absence of sound was everywhere. 

It wasn't just the ship. It was everything. 

The stars, the void, the universe—it was gone. 

Only the Black remained. 

I took a deep breath. For the first time in a long time, I was able to breathe. It was cold, and it hurt, but it was… clean. The air was clean. 

I looked down at the notebook. 

At the butterfly. 

The blood from my hand dripped down on the pages, leaving red stains on the paper, but it was still beautiful. I touched it carefully, not to wipe the blood away, but to let it stay. To let it be a part of it. 

The butterfly wasn't perfect. It was never meant to be. But it was still something. 

And in the Black, I let myself believe that maybe—just maybe—something fragile, something beautiful, could be created after all.
