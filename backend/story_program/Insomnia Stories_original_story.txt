The crunch of leaves beneath my boots was louder than I wanted it to be. The path through the forest was still familiar, the way the trees leaned in close, their branches filtering the sunlight into fractured patterns across the ground. Beside me, Mira strode ahead, her steps confident, almost impatient, her laughter breaking the stillness of the air like ripples across the water. It had been years since we’d last been here, but she carried none of the hesitation I felt.

"So much for growing up, huh?" Mira’s voice rang out, sharp and bright as she turned to look at me, a grin stretching across her freckled face. "You’d think a place like this would get smaller after all this time. But nope. Still so... wild."

“Yeah,” I said quietly, my eyes scanning the dense greenery ahead. “Still wild.”

The sound of the waterfall thread through the silence ahead of us—soft at first, then louder. It rushed up to meet us as we rounded the last bend, and there it was. The gorge. Exactly as it had been in my memories. The waterfall glittered in the sunlight, the pure, foaming cascade tumbling into the clear basin below, its glasslike surface betraying nothing of its depth. Most kids remembered this place as a sanctuary of laughter and summer warmth. Not me. My chest tightened as my gaze inevitably drifted, beyond the falls, to the black mouth of the underwater cave.

The Water Cave.

“You okay?" Mira’s voice snapped me back. I hadn’t realized she’d stopped in her tracks beside me, her hazel eyes studying me with that sisterly mix of amusement and concern. "Don’t tell me this place still spooks you."

I smiled faintly, brushing a strand of hair out of my face. “It doesn’t,” I lied. “It’s just... the memories, I guess.”

She shrugged. “Good memories, hopefully.”

“Some.”

Mira smirked, already turning away from me. “Well, that’s lame.” Her voice rose teasingly as she bounded down the uneven path along the gorge’s edge. “This place was amazing—still is! I’ve missed it so much. We’re totally swimming later, by the way.”

I didn’t answer. Instead, I let myself linger a moment longer, staring at the basin’s calm, rippling surface. The memory bubbled up unbidden—the sharp pull of the whirlpool, the cold grasp of the water, the way it had surged around me like a living thing. Years had passed, but the sensation had never truly left me. Too vivid. Too sharp.

“Elena!” Mira’s impatient shout jarred me. “Don’t be such a slowpoke! Hurry up!”

I sighed and forced my feet to move.

By the time we reached the small clearing near the waterfall, Greg and Luke were already there, sitting on the flat rocks near the edge of the basin. Greg had taken his usual role as the life of the group, waving a worn bag of chips above his head as he called out to us.

“Ladies! Fashionably late as always,” he said with his trademark grin, blonde hair tussled by the wind. “Thought you ditched us for a second there.”

“Yeah, right,” Mira quipped as she dropped her backpack onto the grass. “Like I’d let you have all the fun without me. What’s in the bag?”

“Snacks. And don’t worry—I didn’t scarf them all on the way here.” Greg reached in and pulled out a can of soda, tossing it into the air towards Mira. She snagged it with surprising ease, shooting him a mock salute.

Luke, sitting cross-legged beside Greg, barely looked up. He was skimming a smooth stone across the water’s surface, his movements slow and methodical. “Five skips,” he muttered lowly, more to himself than to anyone else. “Personal best.”

As I approached, Greg gestured dramatically towards the gorge. “Guys, look at this place! Did it shrink, or did the four of us just grow way cooler and taller? Someone should take a picture.”

“Why would we take a picture of you?” Mira teased. She had already rolled up her pant legs and was dipping her toes into the water. “Would ruin the scenery.”

I didn’t laugh. Instead, I knelt down to unpack the thick plaid blanket and spread it out onto the grass. The steady thrum of the waterfall should’ve been soothing, but the unease I felt earlier only deepened. From this angle, I could see the mouth of the Water Cave more clearly. Black and yawning, it seemed impossibly still beneath the water. Almost like it was waiting.

“Elena,” Luke’s soft voice pulled me from my thoughts. “You okay?”

I blinked, startled by his unusually direct tone. The others had been laughing, too caught up in the banter to notice how far away I’d drifted—figuratively, at least. But Luke had noticed. He always noticed.

“Yeah,” I said, nodding a little too quickly. “Just... a lot of memories here. That’s all.”

“Understandable,” he murmured, giving a small, knowing smile before going back to his skipping stones.

Mira bounded over, droplets of water trailing in her wake. “You’re not allowed to get all broody, Elena. It’s illegal. Look at this.” She gestured widely at the scene before us. “How perfect is this place? And no random tourists ruining the vibe. It’s all ours for the day.”

I forced a smile, but my eyes betrayed me, once again wandering back to the cave.

Mira caught me looking. She crossed her arms, tilting her head. “You’re still afraid of it, aren’t you?”

I stiffened. “I’m not afraid.”

“Oh, come on,” she said, dropping onto the blanket beside me. “It’s been years, Elena. It’s a stupid cave.”

“It’s not stupid.” My rebuttal came sharper than I intended. Her teasing expression faded, replaced by something softer.

“Elena...” she started, but I stood abruptly, dusting my hands on my jeans.

“I’m fine,” I said quickly. “I just... I’ll grab the sandwiches.” My voice lacked conviction, but Mira let me go.

As I rummaged through the picnic bag, the laughter of my friends filled the air, buoyant and carefree. Yet it felt distant. The gorge itself felt different now, like the trees and rocks were leaning in, listening. Watching.

And I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was watching back.



The sound of Greg’s laughter echoed across the gorge, sharp and carefree, mingling with the rush of the waterfall. I sat cross-legged on the picnic blanket, staring at the basin as he and Luke splashed in the water like kids who didn’t have a care in the world. Mira had long since left her seat beside me, leaving a damp imprint on the fabric where she had been. Now she was somewhere near the rocks along the edge, her auburn hair glinting in the sunlight as she prepared for what I knew would be another reckless leap.

“Watch this!” Mira’s voice rang out, bold and bright. She stood on the edge, arms spread wide, her grin infectious as the wind tugged at her damp tank top. It was a stance I’d seen so many times before, a promise of something daring, followed by the inevitable leap. This time, though, I couldn’t help the tension that coiled in my chest, a shadow of an old fear whispering beneath my ribs. 

Her body cut through the air with a grace that almost made me envy her confidence, and then she disappeared into the water’s depths. The splash rang out louder than it should have, sharp and jarring, and for a moment, I flinched. My breath hitched as I stared at the ripples spreading out, watching, waiting. Waiting too long.

My skin crawled with the memory of cold water pulling me down, silent and merciless. The whirlpool had gripped me so suddenly back then, dragging me toward the dark mouth of the cave that loomed beneath the falls. I could almost feel it again—the drag of the current, the weight of it all. I forced myself to blink, to focus on the water’s surface.

“Relax,” Greg called from the water, a teasing lilt to his voice. “She’s not gonna drown. Mira’s, like, part fish or something.”

Luke was wading a little farther out. His dark hair was plastered to his forehead as he floated lazily on his back, his gaze tilted toward the sky. “Part fish, part chaos,” he added with a small smile, his voice soft but steady enough to carry over the water.

“It’s not funny,” I said, the words sharper than I intended. My voice felt too tight, like it might snap under the weight of the memory. They didn’t react, their laughter still rising and falling like distant static, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong.

“See?” Mira erupted from the water right in front of Greg, showering him with droplets as she gasped dramatically for air. “Totally alive.”

Greg flinched at the splash and laughed, running a hand through his dripping blond hair. “Could’ve fooled me. For a second, I thought you finally bit off more than you could chew and—”

“Please. I’m untouchable,” she interrupted, shoving him playfully. “Elena’s the only scaredy-cat here.”

I gritted my teeth, my hands tightening on the blanket. The words stung more than they should have, even though I knew she didn’t mean them that way. I could feel her eyes on me, even though I was looking pointedly at the blanket, pretending to rearrange the now-empty sandwich containers.

“Come on, Elena! The water’s amazing!” Mira called to me, her voice floating up from the basin, buoyant and insistent. “Don’t just sit there brooding. Get in here and live a little.”

I shook my head quickly, avoiding her gaze. “I’m not brooding,” I muttered under my breath, though I knew she couldn’t hear me.

Greg groaned theatrically. “She’s scared of the cold water, isn’t she? You always were the serious one.”

“It’s not the cold water,” Mira piped up again, this time in a mock-whisper. “It’s the cave.” Her tone was teasing, but even from this distance, I could hear the edge to it. It was a challenge, deliberate and sharp. 

“She’s right, isn’t she?” Greg stretched out an arm, pointing toward the shadowy mouth beneath the waterfall. “You’re still freaked out by some old underwater hole. Admit it.”

The cave. Just hearing them talk about it made my stomach twist. It loomed in the corner of my vision, dark and empty, as if it were swallowing the light around it. The currents near its entrance swirled unnaturally, the water there churning like it had a life of its own. I couldn’t stop staring at it, couldn’t stop remembering.

“Mira,” I called sharply, cutting through their laughter as she floated a little farther out. “Come back closer to shore.”

She ignored me completely. Instead, she dove again, disappearing into the rippling surface just as I started to rise from the blanket.

“She’s fine,” Luke said from his spot, half-floating, half-watching with a quiet kind of ease. But his words didn’t settle the panic creeping up my spine. He didn’t know. He hadn’t been there. 

Greg was already climbing out of the water, shaking out his arms like a wet dog. “Alright, I’m out. It’s freezing, and I’m officially starving—again.”

Luke hesitated for a moment before following, his gaze flicking briefly between me and Mira’s last known spot in the water. “You okay?” he murmured as he passed by, his voice lower, meant only for me.

I nodded stiffly, though the answer was obvious. He lingered for a beat, then followed Greg toward the trail that led back to the cabin. “Firewood’s not gonna gather itself,” he said quietly over his shoulder.

And then we were alone—the two of us, the water, the sound of the falls, and that damn cave.

“You can’t keep treating me like I’m still thirteen, Elena,” Mira said after a moment, floating on her back with ease. “I’m not a kid anymore.”

“I know that,” I said quietly, though the words felt hollow. There were things I couldn’t explain to her—things buried too deep, too tangled up in the silence of that cave.

“Well, I think I’m proving it,” she said, flipping upright and treading water. “You can’t even get in past your knees, and here I am thinking... maybe I’ll go check out the cave.”

“Don’t,” I said abruptly, the word sharper than I intended.

She frowned, her playful expression faltering. “Come on. It’s not even that far. We always used to talk about going in there, remember?”

“Yeah,” I said, my voice low, “and we never did. For a reason.”

Her arms swept out in wide strokes as she floated closer, closing the gap between us. “The only reason we didn’t is because you were too scared. You’re still scared.”

“It’s not safe, Mira,” I said, trying to keep my voice calm. “You’re a strong swimmer, but you know how fast the currents get out there. I don’t care how good you are.”

“‘Not safe, blah blah blah,’” she mocked, rolling her eyes. “You’ve got the warnings memorized, don’t you?”

I stepped closer to the edge of the water, my pulse hammering. “This place isn’t right, Mira. It never has been. Even you felt it when we were kids.”

“Oh, give me a break.” She paddled farther out, defiance blazing in her eyes. “It’s just a stupid cave. Stop making it into this big, dramatic thing.”

“Mira, I’m serious!” My voice cracked, the panic spilling over. “Please. Just let it go.”

Her movements stilled for a moment, and her gaze softened ever so slightly. “I’m not scared of it, Elena. You don’t need to be scared for me.”

But I was. I always would be.

“Just trust me on this,” I said softly, almost pleading now. “Don’t go near it. Please.”

She hesitated there, treading water in the quiet tension that stretched between us, before letting out a slow breath and turning away.

“Fine,” she muttered, her voice barely audible over the waterfall. “For now.”

But I could see the look on her face, the flicker of defiance, the challenge unspoken. This wasn’t over.



The shadows stretched longer across the gorge, the late afternoon light painting the water in golden ripples. The soft blue sky melted into amber and lavender hues as the sun sank lower, casting an ethereal glow over the scene. Mira wrung the last of the water out of her auburn hair, her grin one of satisfaction as she stretched out on the rocks near the edge. Her earlier defiance had softened into something closer to contentment, but the knot of unease twisting in my stomach didn’t loosen.

Greg and Luke had left earlier, Greg grumbling about snacks while Luke had thrown me a quick, concerned glance before following him up the trail toward the cabin. I almost envied them—their easy laughter, Greg’s loud jokes, and Luke’s quiet, grounding presence. Now, the gorge felt too silent, the absence of their voices leaving only the soft rush of the waterfall and the endless echo of my own thoughts.

Mira sat up suddenly, patting her pockets. “Damn it,” she muttered, twisting around to check the spot where she’d been lounging earlier.

“What is it?” I asked, unable to keep the nervous edge out of my voice.

“My sunglasses,” she said, frowning. “I think I dropped them in the water when I jumped earlier.”

I stiffened. “Maybe they’re still on the rocks. Let’s check again.”

She shook her head, already standing and scanning the water’s edge. “No, I saw something sink when I did that cannonball. I think they fell in.”

“Mira,” I said, her name catching in my throat like a warning.

“It’s fine,” she replied breezily, glancing over her shoulder at me. “I’ll grab them—they can’t have gone far.”

“You don’t even know where they landed,” I said sharply, following her as she stepped carefully toward the slippery stones near the waterline. “Come on, Mira. They’re just sunglasses. Let it go.”

“They were expensive,” she shot back, giving me a pointed look. “And besides, it’s not like you’re offering to dive in and get them for me.”

I ignored the jab, my gaze flickering toward the basin. The water looked calm on the surface, but that calmness never felt right to me. It was too still, too deliberate, as though it were waiting for something.

“You promised you wouldn’t go near the water again,” I said, my voice low but firm. “You said you’d stay away from the cave.”

“I’m not going near the cave,” she replied with an exaggerated roll of her eyes. “Relax, Elena. I’ll stay in the shallow part.”

But her words didn’t reassure me. Her gaze lingered just a little too long on the far end of the basin, where the shadows of the cave’s mouth bled into the deeper, blue-green water. I saw it then—that flicker of challenge in her eyes I knew all too well.

“Mira, don’t,” I said, stepping closer. My voice rose in pitch, sharp and pleading. “It’s not worth it. Please.”

She hesitated for a moment, her expression flickering with something almost like guilt. “I promised I wouldn’t mess around by the cave, and I won’t,” she said softly, as if to placate me. Then she glanced back at the water. “But come on, it’s just for my sunglasses. Relax.”

“Relax?” The word caught in my throat, my frustration spilling over. “This isn’t about sunglasses, and you know it. You’re being reckless—again. Stupid things can spiral into dangerous things, Mira. We’ve seen it happen before.”

Her head tilted slightly, curiosity sparking in her eyes. “You’re talking about that whirlpool thing again, aren’t you?”

The memory hit me like a splash of cold water—the unnatural pull of the current, the way it had yanked at my legs, dragging me toward the gaping darkness of the cave. My chest tightened, and I nodded slowly. “Yeah. The whirlpool. The one that almost pulled me under.”

“You were a kid, Elena,” she said, her voice softening, though there was a dismissive edge to her tone. “You probably misunderstood what was happening. Dad freaked you out, and you blew it up in your head.”

“You weren’t there.” My voice was sharper now, cutting through her dismissiveness like a blade. “You didn’t feel it. It wasn’t just a current—it was alive, Mira. It wanted me.”

She blinked, startled by the force of my words. For a moment, I thought I’d gotten through to her. But then she laughed, a short, incredulous sound that made my chest tighten further.

“You sound like Dad,” she said, shaking her head. “Always so paranoid about this place. You know he used to baby you because he thought you were fragile, right?”

“This has nothing to do with Dad!” I snapped, my voice rising. “You don’t understand what this place is.”

Mira’s expression faltered briefly, hesitation flickering across her face. But just as quickly, it melted away, replaced by that infuriating, stubborn determination. She flashed me a grin—the same one she’d used as a kid whenever she was about to do something reckless. It was the grin that meant you can’t stop me.

“Fine,” she said lightly, tossing a glance over her shoulder. “I’ll stay out of the water.”

Relief began to bloom in my chest, tentative and disbelieving. But it was shattered the second she added, “I’ll just dive into it.”

“Mira, no!” I shouted, lunging forward as she twisted away from me with a laugh. 

“Elena, it’s just sunglasses,” she called, stepping onto a smooth rock at the edge of the basin. “I’ll be back in one piece, okay?”

Before I could stop her, she arced forward, her body slicing through the air like a shadow against the golden sunset. The splash was sharp and clean as she disappeared into the water’s depths.

Seconds ticked by, each one stretching longer in my mind. My breath burned in my chest as though I were the one holding it.

One.  
Two.  
Three.  
Four.  
Five.

“Mira?” I called, my voice cracking. The word echoed faintly across the gorge. Louder this time. “Mira!”

The water rippled, but it gave nothing back. Still. Too still. A tightness clawed at my throat, my breaths coming quicker now.

And then I saw it.

The water near the cave began to move unnaturally, the ripples widening into lazy spirals. The current quickened, tightening into a slow, deliberate swirl near the shadowed mouth of the cave. My heart stopped. The memory crashed over me—a whirlpool dragging me under, its grip cold and unrelenting.

“MIRA!” I screamed, stumbling to my knees at the water’s edge. My boots slipped on the slick rocks, but I didn’t care. I leaned over, gripping the edge as though I could pull her out by sheer will alone. “Please,” I whispered, my voice breaking. “Mira, please.”

A splash stirred the water, and for a fleeting moment, hope flared in my chest. But it wasn’t Mira.

It was her sunglasses, bobbing innocuously on the surface.

She was nowhere to be seen.



I stared at the sunglasses bobbing on the water’s surface, drifting closer to the darkened mouth of the cave. They seemed to mock me, their polished lenses catching what little light was left as though they hadn’t just slipped from Mira’s head only minutes ago. They didn’t belong there, not in this place, not in the shadows that seemed to stretch wider, deeper, with each passing second.

“Mira!” I screamed, my voice cracking, the sound torn from me more out of panic than intent. The roar of the falls swallowed the word whole, and the silence that followed pressed against my ears like stone. I leaned further over the slick rock, my knuckles bone white as they gripped the jagged edge, but all I saw was the water—dark, impenetrable, rippling in lazy spirals.

She wasn’t answering.

My breath came in shallow bursts, every inhale scraping at my throat. My heart pounded, the sound practically drowning out everything else. I couldn’t stop seeing her—Mira, reckless and grinning, standing on the ledge before diving in with that laugh, the one that dared the world to catch her. Now there was only this impossible quiet, except for the sunglasses bobbing on the surface like the last piece of her I had left.

I should jump in. I *had* to jump in.

But the water didn’t look right.  

“Mira!” I shouted again, louder this time, the name tearing through my throat. I waited, willing some reply to cut through the oppressive silence. My stomach twisted when none came, the knot in my chest tightening.

The ripples near the cave weren’t fading. They were growing, pulling tighter and deeper, circling toward some invisible point. My skin prickled as I edged closer to the water, my knees scraping over the damp rock. I felt the fear, cold and sharp, clawing at me, but I forced myself to stay there, to keep looking.

I had to see her. I had to find her.

“Mira, damn it, this isn’t funny!” I yelled, though my voice trembled, shaky and unsure. I tried to picture her rolling her eyes, surfacing with some smartass remark, but that image felt like a lie now—too far from this moment, too far from the cold, growing certainty that something was wrong.

The spirals deepened, their pull more deliberate, more alive. My breath hitched as the water’s surface stilled for just a second, so still I could see my reflection perfectly. My pale face stared back at me, wide-eyed and terrified, but then... it shifted. The image blurred, twisted, until the face looking back wasn’t mine anymore.

The surface broke—not violently, but with a slow, deliberate parting that made my chest tighten. At first, I thought it was Mira, but no... no, it couldn’t be. The shape rising from the water was too wrong. Too *wrong*.  

And then she was there.

Her skin was pale, almost translucent, a waxy sheen clinging to her as if she were carved from the water itself. Her limbs hung limp, drifting just beneath the surface, but her hair—long, black, and impossibly thick—floated around her like dark tendrils. The water clung to her dress, slick black ribbons of fabric that moved unnaturally, as though dragged by invisible hands.  

But it was her face—her *eyes*—that rooted me to the spot.  

Cloudy and unseeing, yet somehow aware, her gaze found mine and didn’t waver. I couldn’t look away, no matter how much I wanted to. Her stare pressed against my chest, heavier than stone, colder than the water beneath her.

A memory surged, unbidden, sharp as a knife.  

I was a child again, standing knee-deep in this gorge, Mira’s laugh echoing as we splashed each other. The adults had been on shore, distracted, until the current pulled me too far. I remembered Mira’s panic, her hand grabbing mine just as Dad’s voice cut through the air.  

But that wasn’t what made it all come flooding back.  

It was her.

The drowned woman. I saw her then, floating facedown in this same water, her hair splayed around her like a dark halo. The adults had rushed us away, their faces pale, their voices hushed with words they thought we couldn’t hear. Mira had whispered to me later, that night, her voice small: *“She was just sleeping, right?”*

But Dad’s voice had been firm, trembling in a way I didn’t understand then: *“She’s not sleeping, Elena.”*

And now she was here. Not lifeless anymore, but impossibly, horrifyingly alive.

“Stay back,” I croaked, my voice faint and pathetic, barely audible over the roar of the falls.

She didn’t move at first. She only floated there, her body swaying with the current, her gaze pinning me in place. Slowly, excruciatingly slowly, her torso began to rise. Water trailed down her face and sunken cheeks, dripping from her blue-tinged lips. Her mouth parted, and a sound rasped out—not quite a breath, but a wet, dragging sound that made bile rise in my throat.

Then she lifted an arm.  

The motion was jerky, mechanical, as though her body didn’t remember how it was supposed to work. Her hand emerged, skeletal fingers trembling as they extended. And then she pointed—toward the cave.  

“No,” I whispered, my voice barely audible.  

Her head tilted, wet strands of hair clinging to her bloated cheeks. She didn’t speak. She didn’t move again. She just pointed, her finger unwavering, a silent command—or maybe a threat.  

For a moment, I thought I saw something in her eyes, something familiar. It wasn’t her, not the drowned woman from all those years ago. It was... Mira. A flicker of her defiance, her fire. But as quickly as it came, it was gone, swallowed by the cloudy haze.

I couldn’t breathe.  

The water spiraled tighter, the pull growing deeper, hungrier. Something larger stirred beneath her, a shadow too massive to be real.  

“I... I can’t,” I stammered, though I wasn’t even sure what I was refusing. My legs trembled, my body frozen in place.  

The spirit didn’t react. Her dead, piercing gaze held me for a moment longer before she began to sink. Slowly, deliberately, she slipped beneath the surface without a ripple, the water closing over her like she’d never been there at all.

The spirals remained, lazy and hypnotic, spinning toward the cave. The sunglasses drifted closer to the pull, caught in its slow, inexorable current.

“Mira,” I whispered, her name burning in my throat. I collapsed forward, clutching the wet stone, my breaths ragged and uneven. I felt the tears on my cheeks before I realized I was crying, the weight of the scene crashing down on me.

Then I heard it—a faint splash, deeper in the shadows of the cave.  

My head snapped up.  

“Mira?”  

The cave loomed darker than ever, its entrance a gaping maw. My legs shook as I forced myself to my feet, the cold air biting at my damp skin.  

I couldn’t leave her. I wouldn’t leave her.  

But for the first time, I wasn’t sure if I was saving her—or walking into something far worse.  



The sunglasses bobbed once more before being sucked into the lazy spiral near the cave, vanishing beneath the surface as though they had never existed at all. My breath caught, the quiet so vast it consumed every anxious beat of my heart. Seconds ticked by, measured only by the shallow gasps I managed to drag into my tightening chest, and the ominous churn of the whirlpool echoed in my ears like a distant threat.  

And then the surface broke.  

It was explosive—loud and chaotic. Mira’s head snapped up from the water, her auburn hair plastered over her face, her soaked form emerging with a splash that sent ripples cutting through the whirlpool’s edge.  

“Whooo!” she hollered between gasps, her voice sharp and high, as though she’d just scored the winning point in a game. She coughed once, then laughed, water glistening on her flushed cheeks as her voice rose above the steady roar of the waterfall.  

Relief hit me so hard it almost knocked me over. My knees buckled, and I caught myself on the slick rock with my palms, the rough texture scraping my skin. My chest heaved with something too tangled to define—terror, elation, anger. Tears blurred my vision as I opened my mouth to call her name, but all that came out was a ragged, broken breath that scraped like sandpaper in my throat.  

“Mira!” I croaked at last, my voice trembling and hoarse.  

She beamed up at me, treading water with an easy, practiced rhythm, completely unfazed by the panic tearing me apart. “Elena! You’re not gonna believe—wait, okay, hang on—” She coughed again, spitting out a mouthful of water. “Whew. That whirlpool, though, huh? I thought I was stuck for a second, but I kicked free. Got spun around a bit, but it was fine. Just had to let the current do its thing.” She grinned, throwing her arms wide in triumph. “Totally worth it!”  

“You thought—you thought you were *stuck*?” My voice cracked on the word, and I scrambled to my feet despite the trembling in my legs. “Mira, you could have died!”  

“But I didn’t!” she said breezily, brushing off my panic as if it were made of mist. “Come on, Elena. I’ve been doing this stuff my whole life. You know that.” She swam closer to the rock’s edge, lifting one hand above the surface as though presenting a trophy. “And look what I found!”  

The light caught on something in her fist, glinting faintly as she held it aloft.  

“Mira,” I whispered, shaking my head as unease surged through me, cutting through the relief like a knife. My fingers curled into the slippery stone beneath me. “What were you thinking? Why did you—”  

“Chill,” she interrupted, her tone light, dismissive. “Seriously, it wasn’t a big deal. You’re always so dramatic. Plus, check this out.” She tossed the object toward me, and my hands shot out instinctively, catching it midair before it could fall.  

It was a necklace, old and exquisite. The thin chain felt fragile in my hands, tarnished in places but still impossibly detailed. At its center hung a pendant shaped like a violin, its edges engraved with looping floral patterns so fine they looked like frost etched into glass. The tiny strings were intact, impossibly delicate.  

My stomach churned, and my pulse pounded in my ears. The chilled weight of the necklace felt wrong in my hand—like it didn’t belong here. Like it didn’t belong to us.  

“What is this?” I asked, almost afraid to hold it for too long.  

“Treasure,” Mira declared with a wide, triumphant grin, pulling herself out of the water in one fluid motion. She crouched beside me, dripping and grinning despite the cold air clinging to her soaked skin. “And that’s not all.” She held up another chain—simpler, with three pearls strung in perfect alignment. There was a subtle elegance to it, the kind that whispered of wealth, of lives far removed from ours.  

I stared at the necklaces in my hands, unable to shake the growing weight pressing heavily in my chest. My gaze returned to the violin pendant, and the memory slammed into me with startling clarity: the drowned woman. Her sunken face. Her cloudy eyes. And this exact necklace resting just above the throat that would never breathe again.  

“Mira.” My voice wavered, and I forced myself to look at her. “You shouldn’t have taken these.”  

Her grin faltered, and she tilted her head, her expression quizzical but still amused. “What? Why not? They were just lying there. No one’s been down there in forever.”  

“You don’t understand,” I said, my voice tight with rising dread.  

Her hazel eyes flicked toward the violin pendant still resting in my palm. “What are you talking about?”  

“I’ve seen this before.” The words spilled out before I could stop them.  

Her frown deepened. “What do you mean? Seen it where?”  

I hesitated, my throat tightening as the image of the drowned woman burned itself behind my eyes. “It—it belonged to her. The woman... I saw her. In the water.”  

Mira stared at me for a moment, then let out a short, incredulous laugh. “Elena, seriously? You’re saying this necklace belonged to some... ghost or something?”  

“She wasn’t just... a ghost.” My voice shook as I glanced toward the cave, the shadows near its mouth darker, deeper, as though something was still moving beneath the surface. “She was... watching me. Pointing. And this—this was hers. I know it was.”  

Mira’s expression shifted, a flicker of hesitation breaking through her bravado. She glanced at the necklace again, then shrugged, shaking the doubt away like droplets of water from her hair. “That’s... That’s crazy, Elena,” she said, though her voice had softened slightly. “You were probably just imagining things. It’s your anxiety talking. It always is.”  

The words hit harder than they should have, cutting deep in the way only Mira’s dismissal could.  

“Mira, please,” I whispered. “Leave it. Put it back. It’s not right. It’s—”  

“It’s fine,” she interrupted, her grin returning, though it didn’t quite reach her eyes this time. She snatched the violin pendant from my hand and twisted it between her fingers, admiring its craftsmanship. “This is amazing. A lucky dive, that’s all. I’m keeping it. Consider it a reward for braving the depths.”  

I couldn’t move. I couldn’t speak. My eyes stayed fixed on the pendant as she slipped it around her neck, the delicate chain resting lightly against her collarbone.  

And I couldn’t ignore the way the shadows near the cave seemed to shift again, darker now, as though something below hadn’t quite let go.  



The fire crackled softly, its light licking the surrounding darkness with fleeting warmth. I sat cross-legged on a slab of damp rock, a wool blanket Mira had dragged from her pack draped over my shoulders, and stared into the flames. It did little to thaw the icy dread that had settled in my chest since the moment Mira emerged from the water, triumphant and defiant, clutching those cursed necklaces. She’d slipped the violin pendant over her head shortly after, brushing off my protests with a wave of her hand. Now it gleamed at her throat, catching the firelight with every subtle shift of her body, and I couldn’t stop looking at it, couldn’t stop remembering who it had belonged to.  

Mira lounged across from me, her hair still damp but curling as it dried, stray tendrils sticking out in the unkempt way that somehow always fit her. She toyed absentmindedly with the pendant at her throat, the delicate strings of the violin glinting in the firelight as her fingers traced its edges. I wanted to scream at her to take it off, to throw it back into the water where it belonged, but my words were trapped behind the knot of unease tightening in my chest.  

The absence of Greg and Luke made everything worse. They had left earlier in the day to head back to the cabin, their laughter fading into the trees and leaving Mira and me alone out here. The solitude pressed heavier around us now, the crackle of the fire the only sound in the oppressive night.  

"We should leave," I said finally, breaking the brittle quiet between us. My voice came out low and strained, like the words had scraped against something raw on their way out.  

Mira snorted softly, not even glancing up as she poked idly at the fire with a stick. Sparks danced into the cold night air. “Leave? Are you serious? After all that? No way.”  

I swallowed hard, gripping the edges of the blanket as though they could anchor me. The words crowded my throat, clamoring to be spoken, but I forced myself to take a breath. “Mira,” I began, my voice unsteady, “you don’t understand. That necklace... it’s not just some random thing you found. It’s hers. I know it is.”  

At that, she finally looked up. Her hazel eyes were warm, playful, but with an edge of irritation creeping in. “Elena,” she said, dragging my name with a weary sort of patience, “you have got to let this thing go. We’ve been through this. There’s no creepy drowned woman following us around just because I picked up some jewelry. You’re freaking yourself out—again.”  

I flinched at the edge in her tone, but I didn’t look away. “I saw her, Mira. I saw her!” My voice wavered, but I pushed through, leaning forward, willing her to understand. “She wasn’t some hallucination or nightmare. She was real. She was in the water, and she was pointing—at you. At the cave.”  

Mira let out a frustrated breath and tossed the stick into the flames. It hissed as the damp wood met the heat. “This again.” She shook her head, leaning back onto her elbows as though the conversation itself was exhausting. “Elena, you’re always like this. Always jumping to the worst-case scenario. Always reading into things that aren’t there. Just because you think you saw a ghost doesn’t mean it was real. You were in full panic mode—of course your brain was messing with you.”  

Her dismissal cut sharp and deep, the way her words always did when they framed me as small and broken. I clenched the blanket tighter around me, the fire’s warmth feeble against the cold that was creeping up my spine. My gaze drifted back to the pendant, to the way it gleamed against her skin, and the memory clawed its way up before I could stop it: the pale, lifeless face of the woman in the water, her empty eyes staring through me, the violin pendant glinting against her throat like it was alive.  

“It was real,” I insisted, my voice ragged. “Her eyes... Mira, they were dead, so empty, but there was something in them too. She wasn’t...” I trailed off, trying to put words to what felt impossible to say. “She wasn’t human. Not anymore.”  

Mira sat up then, crossing her legs to mirror me, her jaw tightening as she leaned closer. “You’re spiraling,” she said flatly. “You’re doing that thing where you let your anxiety twist everything until you can’t even see reality anymore.” She gestured at the blanket swaddled around me. “Look at you. You’re still shaking like... like she climbed out of the water and followed you here. Does that sound sane to you?”  

“No, but—”  

“Exactly.” She threw her hands up and fell back onto her palms again, her movements sharp with frustration. “This was supposed to be fun, Elena. You remember what fun is, right? That thing where you go somewhere new, do something crazy, laugh a little?” Her voice had taken on that condescending edge I hated, the one that always made me feel like I was sixteen again, cowering beneath her recklessness.  

A knot tightened in my chest. I forced myself to sit straighter, digging my nails into the rough weave of the blanket. “Do you remember,” I started quietly, but with an edge that surprised even me, “what happened here when we were kids? Do you remember the body we saw?”  

Her smug grin faltered.  

Her eyebrows pinched together, but she didn’t say anything.  

“She isn’t just some made-up ghost, Mira,” I said, my voice gaining strength, though it still shook beneath the weight of the memory. “She was here. We saw her. That day Dad made us get out of the water so fast we didn’t even know why until it was too late.”  

“Elena...”  

“She drowned here, Mira! Right here! And now you’re wearing her necklace like it’s some souvenir.”  

The silence between us was heavy, oppressive, eating up the space where she should have replied. When she finally spoke, her voice was softer but no less defensive. “So what? Plenty of people have probably drowned here over the years.”  

I stared at her, disbelief twisting my face. “Are you even listening to yourself? She was already haunting this place when we were kids! Don’t you remember how Dad wouldn’t even let us talk about it after? How Mom looked so scared when we got home? They saw her too!”  

“Stop it,” she snapped, her sharper tone cutting through the thick air like a blade. “I’m not doing this with you, okay? I’m not—what, supposed to throw these necklaces back because of some bedtime ghost story you’ve decided is real now? God, Elena. Listen to yourself.”  

I opened my mouth to argue, but when my gaze flicked to the violin pendant again, hanging there so casually, cutting through the space between us like a breath, my voice caught in my throat. It glinted in the firelight like a warning, though Mira didn’t seem to notice it anymore.  

Instead, she shook her head with a huff, reaching for her pack and rummaging for the sleeping bag she’d tossed somewhere earlier. “I’m done,” she announced, her voice brisk and edged with finality. “I’m cold. I’m tired. And I’m definitely not spending the rest of this trip arguing about your overactive imagination. You want to play scaredy-cat, go for it, but leave me out of it.”  

“Mira—”  

“No.” She cut me off, standing up and shaking out the sleeping bag with a sharp snap. “I swear, Elena, you will twist yourself into knots worrying about everything. Can’t we just have this one trip? Why does everything have to be about this... this tension you carry around like some cross to bear? I had fun today. I’m fine. And the necklaces are fine too. Now, just—drop it.”  

She rolled herself into her sleeping bag near the fire where the shadows didn’t look as thick. “Goodnight,” she said, her voice muffled, already turned away.  

I sat there, the only sound the snap and crackle of the fire, its light flickering across her still form. My hands gripped the rock beneath the blanket so tightly my fingers ached, but I didn’t move. I couldn’t.  

The pendant gleamed once more in the firelight, its delicate strings almost quivering in the heat waves.  

And beyond the light of the fire, at the edge of the water, I thought I saw something move.  



**Rewritten Scene:**

The fire had burned low, now little more than a faint orange glow peeking beneath the charred remains of logs. Shadows stretched and yawned across the shoreline, their shapes twisting with each sputter and pop of the dying embers. Mira’s steady breathing was loud in the near silence, her form cocooned in her sleeping bag near the fire. She had rolled onto her side, her back to me. Before settling in, she’d tugged the violin pendant from her neck, muttering something about it digging into her skin. With a soft huff of annoyance, she’d tossed it near the edge of the fire, where it now caught faint glints of light, its strings gleaming like spider silk.

I didn’t know when I’d finally convinced myself to close my eyes, but the exhaustion must have won eventually. My body sagged beneath the weight of it, my thoughts chasing themselves in endless circles. Even then, my dreams were restless, shifting and fractured, drenched in cold water and clouded eyes. Always, always, her eyes. Watching. Waiting.

I stirred briefly when I heard the faint rustle of movement nearby—Mira. I cracked my eyes open just long enough to see her shape, a blur of shadows against the firelight, as she unzipped her sleeping bag and stood. She muttered something, words too quiet to make out, but the word "water" reached me through the haze of half-sleep. “Mira?” I murmured, my voice sluggish with exhaustion. She didn’t respond, just padded toward the shoreline with unhurried steps. My body protested as I tried to sit up, and the weight of sleep dragged me back down. I told myself I’d follow in a moment, but my eyes slipped closed again.

The sound of splashing jolted me awake.

Not distant, not faint. Close. Too close.

My heart slammed against my ribs as I shot up, the blanket falling from my shoulders in a heavy heap. My eyes darted to Mira’s sleeping bag, now nothing more than a crumpled pile of fabric near the fire. The indent of her body remained fresh, but she wasn’t there.

“Mira?” My voice was shaky, barely more than a whisper at first, the word catching in my throat. I scrambled to my feet, my pulse hammering now as the splash came again—not loud, but deliberate. Rhythmic. A sound that carried an awful weight of intention.

“Mira!” Panic sharpened my voice this time, cutting through the brittle air as I turned in frantic circles. The trees loomed too dark around me, the firelight casting flickering shadows that made every crevice feel like a threat. No response came. Only the soft lap of water.

I moved toward the water’s edge, the earth cold and uneven beneath my bare feet. The icy dread pressing into my chest was almost paralyzing as I stopped at the shoreline, staring hard at the smooth surface of the still-rippling lake. Something was wrong—so profoundly wrong it clogged the air in my lungs.

“Mira, this isn’t funny! Come out!” I called again, my voice breaking on the last word, and clenched my fists to stop the trembling in my hands. The only answer was the faint echo of my own voice rolling back toward me.

Then I saw them: ripples across the surface, their gentle arcs stretching toward the dark mouth of the cave.

I couldn’t breathe. My thoughts tripped over one another, a tangle of dread and disbelief and growing certainty. Mira had been here—her sleeping bag wasn’t far, and I’d heard her moving—but now she wasn’t. And those ripples, steady, unrelenting, were leading me back to the place I’d begged her to stay away from.

The cave.

My stomach twisted violently as I stared at the opening, a black wound at the base of the towering cliffs that loomed over the water’s edge. I felt rooted in place, unable to tear my gaze away from its emptiness. And then, just for an instant, something shifted inside it—a flicker of movement, then a faint glow, soft and muted, like moonlight on deep water.

And she was there.

Not Mira. Not alive. The drowned woman stood just beyond the reach of the night, dark hair fanning out like ink suspended in water. Her hollow eyes gleamed faintly, catching the weak light of the stars, and her outline wavered as though she wasn’t entirely solid, her form tethered somewhere between this world and the next. But her gaze—her gaze didn’t waver. It was pinned to me, sharp and unyielding, holding me in place as though her stare alone could drag me under.

“No,” I whispered, shaking my head, the word spilling unbidden from my lips. “This isn’t real. It can’t be real.”

But it was.

The weight of her presence pressed against my chest, crushing the breath from me. And even as my primal fear screamed at me to turn and run, I couldn’t move. Not away. Not this time. Not while Mira was still out there.

My eyes dropped toward the fire as I searched desperately for some anchor, some tether to reality. And then I saw it: the violin pendant, glinting faintly where Mira must’ve left it near the edge of the fire. The sight of it sent a cold, bone-deep shiver down my spine. My hand closed around it before I could think, the chilled metal biting into my palm. As my fingers tightened, a strange warmth spread through the pendant, threading itself through the fear in my mind.

The spirit didn’t move. She didn’t step forward, didn’t reach out—didn’t threaten. Her eerie, unwavering presence wasn’t violent. As I clutched the pendant, realization struck with the weight of certainty. She wasn’t here to harm. She was pointing. Guiding. Protecting.

“Mira,” I whispered, her name trembling on my breath as I turned toward the water.

The freezing shock of the lake hit me like a slap to the chest as I dove in. My limbs burned instantly, the cold clamping down on my muscles with merciless force, but I shoved the pain away and swam. The pendant pulsed faintly in my grip, the glow from the cave intensifying as though it was pulling me forward, illuminating the path in the murky water.

It felt like an eternity, every stroke of my arms sluggish against the numbing cold that seeped into my blood, but I didn’t stop. I couldn’t stop. The glow inside the cave didn’t fade—it remained steady, just out of reach, pulling me forward like a lifeline tethered to some unseen shore.

I felt her before I saw her.

Mira.

Her body floated just beneath the surface near the mouth of the cave, her auburn hair fanned out like a halo, her face pale and still in the dark water. Frantic, I dove down, my shaking hands grasping for her as my lungs screamed for air. The light guided me even here, illuminating her form and the dark roots tangled around her legs, holding her in place like hands that refused to let her go.

My fingers worked desperately, clawing at the roots, peeling them away one by one until my arms ached with the effort. Finally, with one last pull, she came free, limp but whole, and I kicked hard for the surface. The cold air hit my face like a knife’s edge as I broke through, dragging Mira with me, her weight more than I felt I could carry. But I carried it all the same.

We reached the shore together, the rocks slick beneath my hands as I hauled her out of the water. I collapsed beside her, coughing and gasping for air that felt like fire in my chest, and rolled her onto her side. Her body was lifeless, still, her skin too cold against mine.

“Mira,” I choked, forcing myself to move, to scream as I pressed against her chest. “Mira, wake up!”

My shaking hands pressed firmly, over and over, water spilling from her lips as I worked, desperation driving me onward. And then, mercifully, a cough—a gasp. Her body spasmed as water poured from her mouth, and her hazel eyes fluttered open, dazed and unfocused.

“Elena...” she rasped, her voice broken and weak.

Tears blurred my vision as I clutched her to me, the necklace still clutched in my trembling hand, its edges pressing sharp against my skin. I dared to glance toward the water. The light had faded. The spirit was gone.

But something deep within me knew: she had saved us both.



The riverbank was cold beneath me, the dampness seeping through my soaked clothes and into my bones as I cradled Mira’s limp form in my arms. Every breath I took scraped against the rawness in my throat, shallow and uneven, but I couldn’t stop—couldn’t let myself collapse. Her auburn hair clung to her face, plastered there like a shroud, and I used a trembling hand to brush it back, my fingers shaking from the chill or maybe from fear. Above us, the sky was a bleak canvas of ashen gray, dawn’s light bleeding faintly over the horizon but doing nothing to ease the oppressive cold that clung to the gorge. 

“Mira,” I rasped, my voice cracking as I shook her gently. “Come on. Please. You’ve got to wake up.” 

Her face was pale—too pale—and her lips were tinged with blue, as though the last bit of warmth had abandoned her body. I tilted my head down to watch for any sign of life, my eyes fixed on her chest, begging to see the faintest rise and fall. Anything. 

But there was nothing. 

“No.” The word broke from me—a frantic, guttural sound that tore at my throat. 

I pressed the heel of my hand into her sternum and began compressions again, barely able to keep count as panic threatened to smother me. My hands slipped against her drenched t-shirt, the fabric clinging to her like a second skin, and my arms ached with every push, but I didn’t stop. I couldn’t stop. Water spilled from her lips as I tipped her head back, my own breaths coming harder and faster, the sound of them mixing with the rhythmic pounding of my palms against her chest. 

“Mira!” I screamed her name, the sound raw and jagged as it fractured the stillness of the gorge. “You don’t get to do this to me! You don’t—you don’t get to leave me here alone!”

The words dissolved into a broken sob. I bit down hard, forcing the pain inward, forcing myself to keep going, even as tears spilled freely down my face. The forest loomed around me, the silence so heavy it felt suffocating, save for the desperate sounds of my efforts. 

And then she coughed. 

It was faint at first, barely audible over the pounding in my ears, but then her body spasmed in my arms, jerking as she heaved forward. A rush of water spilled from her lips, and I let out a strangled cry of relief, stumbling back as she gasped, clutching weakly at her chest. Her hazel eyes fluttered open, unfocused and glassy, and she blinked up at me in confusion. 

“Elena...?” Her voice was barely a whisper, raw and rasping, but it was her.

A laugh bubbled out of me, shaky and hysterical, as I pressed a trembling hand against her shoulder to steady myself. “You’re such an idiot,” I choked out, tears still streaming down my cheeks. “You scared the hell out of me.”

She coughed again, rolling slightly to her side as more water spilled from her lips. Her limbs trembled beneath her, frail and unsteady, and she shivered violently despite the faint warmth of the rising sun. “Wha—what happened?” she rasped, her brows knitting together as she tried to push herself up.

“Don’t,” I said quickly, my hand darting out to press gently against her shoulder and keep her down. “Just—just stay still. You went into the water. Do you remember that?” 

She blinked at me, her lips parting as though to answer, but then her expression faltered. Her gaze drifted toward the shoreline, where the necklaces lay untouched, their delicate chains glittering faintly in the dim light. Her hand came up shakily, brushing over her collarbone as if searching for something that wasn’t there, and her face crumpled. 

“The necklaces...” she whispered, her voice trembling. “I—I shouldn’t have—” She broke off, her hand falling limply to her side as her eyes squeezed shut. “I shouldn’t have touched them.”

I froze, my stomach twisting. This was the same Mira who had clung to the violin pendant with such defiance, insisting it was harmless—insisting it was hers. And now, her voice was laced with something I wasn’t used to hearing from her. Guilt. Fear. 

“It’s okay,” I said softly, though I wasn’t sure I believed it myself. “We’re getting rid of them. As soon as we leave.”

Her eyes snapped open at that, and she grabbed weakly at my arm, her fingers trembling but insistent. “We’re not staying,” she said, her voice faint but urgent. “Not another second.” 

I nodded quickly, my throat tight as I helped her sit up. “We’ll leave as soon as you’re ready,” I murmured, though I could already see how badly she was struggling. Her arms gave out beneath her almost immediately, and she slumped against me, her breathing shallow and uneven. 

“Don’t,” I whispered, my grip firm on her shoulders. “I’ll take care of it. Just rest. You’re too weak.” 

She didn’t argue, her head dipping against my chest as she shivered uncontrollably. “I’m so cold,” she whispered. 

“I know,” I murmured, wrapping the blanket tighter around her frail frame. “Just hold on a little longer. We’ll get you warm.” 

Her gaze shifted toward the lake then, and her entire body went rigid against me. “The cave,” she whispered, her voice trembling. “I—I don’t remember why, but I feel like... like something’s still there.”

I didn’t answer. I didn’t need to. My eyes followed hers to the necklaces lying abandoned near the dying fire, and for a moment, I debated throwing them into the water. But my hand froze halfway to the pendant, my fingers tightening on the delicate chains. A chill slid down my spine, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that angering whatever force lingered here was a mistake I didn’t want to make. 

Instead, I shoved the necklaces into the dirt by the bank, burying them shallowly beneath the mud. My hand hovered for a moment, trembling, before I stood and turned back to Mira. “We’ll leave them here. They’re not coming with us.”

Her lips parted as though to protest, but then she nodded weakly, sagging against me again. “Good,” she murmured. “We shouldn’t take them. We can’t...”

I helped her pack in silence, though it was mostly me fumbling with her belongings while she leaned heavily against my side. Her hands trembled too badly to secure anything herself, and I didn’t push her to try. She avoided my gaze the entire time, her movements slow and mechanical, as though some part of her was still caught in the water’s pull. 

When everything was packed, I hauled both of our bags onto my shoulders and steadied Mira against me. My gaze drifted unbidden to the shoreline one last time, toward the dark expanse of water stretching beneath the waking sky. 

And there she was—the drowned woman. She stood at the mouth of the cave, her translucent form swaying like smoke above the surface. Her hair floated around her face in tendrils, her empty eyes fixed on me with an expression I couldn’t name. Not malice. Not kindness. Just... knowing. 

I blinked, and she was gone, swallowed by the depths. 

“Elena?” Mira’s voice was barely audible, but it grounded me. 

I turned back to her, gripping her shoulder lightly. “Let’s go.”

We left the gorge behind us, the forest swallowing our retreat as though we’d never been there at all. The silence crept back in, broken only by Mira’s unsteady breathing. 

I didn’t look back again. But as we walked, I made a silent vow. We would never return. Some places are meant to keep their secrets.
