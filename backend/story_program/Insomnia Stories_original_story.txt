The maintenance bay groaned around me, a low, agonized sound that reverberated through the rusting hull. Oil dripped in lazy, rhythmic plinks from ruptured pipes, pooling on the uneven floor beneath my boots. The acrid stench clung to the back of my throat, mixing with the metallic tang of decay. I didn’t dare breathe too deeply. Not here. Not when the air felt so thin, poisoned, almost alive. 

The tools in my hands clinked faintly as I tightened a connection on the grotesque mass before me. Flesh wound through machinery, sinew wrapping like coiled wire around once-pristine components that had long since turned to ruin. I couldn’t look at certain parts—pale, taut layers of translucent tissue stretched over gears or the unmistakable curve of a broken-off fingertip somewhere deep in the mess—but I made myself find the patterns, the places where metal met the organic. It was the only way I could work. The life-support system groaned in protest as I adjusted another valve, sending a tremor through the amalgamation. It seemed to shudder beneath my hands, viscera alive with memory and resistance.

That’s when the first flash came. 

A distorted face, lips peeled back in a scream, eyes pleading, flickered through the machine like a reflection caught in shattered glass. I froze, my breath snagging in my throat. The echo of a voice—not a voice, a scream—pulsed through my skull like a distant, muffled hammer. My hands trembled against the panel, and for a moment, I couldn’t move. 

No. Don’t stop. Don’t let it creep in.

I forced the wrench back into motion, even as my fingers shook so badly that I nearly dropped it. More flashes came, fragmented but vivid—flesh rendered raw, despair twisting in features I couldn’t fully recognize. They’d become part of the ship now, their final cries trapped in this pulsating grotesquerie masquerading as machinery. Sweat dripped into my eyes, blurring the nightmares within the metal. I focused on the hiss of steam from a ruptured tube, the droning thrum of the engines somewhere far below, anything but the faces.

And then the feeling hit me. That presence. Cold and suffocating, it pressed down on my chest as though the air itself wanted to claw me open. It was here. Watching. 

The light above flickered. Once. Twice. My heart jolted.

I turned slowly, wrench half-raised, straining to hear past the engine’s distortion. At first, everything was dormant—the hum buzzing in my ears, the faint drip of oil. Then it came, drifting faintly from behind me.

Skittering.

I gripped the wrench tightly, the metal biting into my palm. It was deliberate, almost playful—a soft scrabble, as though claws scraped against the venting system. My chest tightened, and I willed myself to breathe. In. Out. Don’t panic, Kai.

“Kai. Focus,” I whispered to myself under my breath, my voice barely audible.

I shifted my gaze back to the life-support system. The repairs weren’t finished. If I didn’t get it running again, we’d all suffocate in a matter of hours. But that sound... that thing in the dark... was it moving closer?

The skittering stopped. The silence was worse.

“Just stay there,” I muttered. To it. To me. To no one. My voice cracked, but I swallowed the mounting hysteria and returned to the flickering panel. My hands worked mechanically, fingers finding the wires and conduits almost on instinct. I leaned in too close, desperate to drown out the oppressive emptiness surrounding me. And yet, despite my grasp for focus, my thoughts betrayed me.

A butterfly. Fragile, translucent wings. Something delicate, adrift, too perfect for this ship—a warmth I’d never felt but could so vividly imagine. The image surfaced again now, unbidden, absurd. Hope? No. It wasn’t hope. It was just foolishness. A cruel trick of the mind.

A crash from the far side of the room shattered my fantasy. 

I spun, wrench raised, my heart slamming in my ribs like it wanted out. A tool had fallen, skidding across the greased floor until it tapped lifelessly against the bulkhead. I stared at it, searching the shadows beyond. My gray eyes trailed into the dark corners where the light from the failing bulb didn’t reach.

Something moved.

Just a ripple, a stirring in the blackness—barely perceptible, but enough for me to know I wasn’t alone. My grip on the wrench tightened as my voice broke free in a whisper.

“I know you’re out there.”

The skittering sound returned, this time louder, scattered, darting from left to right. My stomach churned. I took a slow, tentative step back, boots slick against the oil-coated floor. The light flickered wildly now, casting jagged, stuttering shadows across the bulkheads. My pulse was deafening in my ears.

And then—just as suddenly as it started—it stopped.

The panel on the life-support system let out a shrill whine, dragging me back into the present. Sparks erupted around the conduit I’d been adjusting, a crackle of electricity snapping against my exposed forearm. I winced but forced myself toward it, already fumbling for the insulation tool. The systems screamed protest, nearly drowning out the faint echoes from the corridor outside—nearly, but not entirely.

Behind me, I heard it: a low, guttural chitter. Not skittering anymore. Laughter. Pure malice.

And then came the voice.

“You’re... wasting... time.”

It wasn’t human. It didn’t even sound whole. Layered, splintered. But I knew what it meant, what it wanted. My hands shook, useless on the panel.

I turned back toward the shadows, heart slamming harder against my ribs.

But there was nothing there.





The control room was cold. Colder than I remembered. The thin recycled air seemed to barely cling to life, coursing weakly through the vent systems like the dying heartbeat of the ship itself. The hiss of static from a wall of flickering monitors filled the space, each screen displaying something different—fractured diagnostic readings that blurred and twitched, external camera feeds shrouded in endless black, and distorted schematics of our vessel splintered by digital noise. The fluorescent lighting overhead buzzed faintly, a sound just sharp enough to needle into my brain. Everything about this room felt wrong.

Jackson stood near the center console, silhouetted against the angry glow of a malfunctioning monitor. His broad shoulders seemed to sag more than usual, weighed down by years he hadn't yet lived. He didn’t look at me as I entered, but his presence filled the room regardless, a fixture of heavy tension. Dr. Anna Nair was already to one side, perched on the edge of the console with one leg crossed tightly over the other, her hazel eyes distant, lips pulled in a thin line. Her posture was poised, but she wasn’t fooling anyone. Not here.

Two others—survivors whose names I should have said mornings to more often when there were mornings to mark—sat slumped at the far end of the room, silent, their eyes glazed over but flitting fixatedly to shadows that didn’t move. I didn’t have to guess what they were thinking about. I could almost hear their thoughts, circling endlessly, as loud and useless as argument. They hadn’t said a word since the last attack. I doubted now if they ever would again.

I crossed the room, my boots softly scraping against the grated floor. The cold metal seeped up through my soles, snaking like frost into my bones. I kept my wrench in one hand—more habit than defense—though my arm ached dully from clenching it so tightly. 

“Kai,” Jackson said suddenly, his gruff voice tearing through the low hum of the monitors. He didn’t turn around. Just said it like he’d been waiting for me. “You’re late.”

“You noticed.” The words slipped out sharp, sharper than they needed to be. I regretted them the instant they landed, but Jackson didn’t react. Correction: Jackson barely reacted. His shoulders rose just slightly, almost imperceptibly, as though I’d reminded him he possessed lungs. 

Crossing to my usual station, I leaned into the cold edge of the table and forced my breath to steady. The weight of a single word—conversation—hung heavy, and no one seemed eager to be the one to break it. Jackson finally moved. He turned, his hazel eyes meeting mine briefly before drifting out over the room, over the mess that was left of us. His beard was more gray than I remembered even a week ago, and his skin looked loose, hanging onto his jaw as though it might give up and slide away. There were marks on his face—darkened crescents where he hadn’t slept properly in days. 

“You know why I called this,” Jackson said, his voice low and quiet but unyielding as steel. He didn’t bother asking for agreement. No one here ever really did. I doubted they remembered how—a crew without consensus, just splinters scraping the same hull. 

To his left, Anna stirred. She uncrossed her legs, cool hazel eyes locking on Jackson. “’Calling this’ feels generous,” she said softly, her voice that strange mix of warmth and razor I’d come to count on from her. “You say the word, we all come running like dogs. Is that protocol now?” She tilted her head slightly, a faint, unsettling smile tugging at the corner of her lips. It was the kind of smile that shouldn’t belong to someone who still genuinely cared but somehow did.

Jackson’s gaze hardened, but not enough to extend beyond weariness. “Drop it, Anna. You know what we’re fighting. You know how bad it is now.”

“Do I?” she asked, softly again, but there was no doubt. “You think I don’t see what’s happening with my own eyes, Jackson? Or hear it?”

Her voice softened more, but her words hit harder than the wrench in my hand ever could. I didn’t have the strength to add anything—not yet. Not until Jackson started speaking again.

“We’re losing,” Jackson said. Just like that. His voice cracked at the word. “If that wasn’t clear before, let this be it. We’re... bleeding hours.”

I could feel the argument starting—feel it building in the space between us all before the rest of the words even formed thoughts. My fists tightened against the cold edge of the table. He took a step forward, heavy and deliberate.

“This ship? It doesn’t belong to us anymore. We're just...” He gestured vaguely back at the monitors, a sharp motion like he wanted to throw his hand through the static-riddled screens. “The Somethings— they—own what’s left of this. We’re barely ghosts in their nightmare. Do you even remember what we’re fighting to save at this point?”

I surged upright, the movement instinctive. “Don’t start.”

He stared at me for the first time, his expression unreadable, but something fractured in his eyes. “What?” he said, his tone sharpening for the first time all night, his words louder now against the flickering hum of the room. “Don’t start? I don’t know what to tell you anymore, Kai. How many of us need to die before you accept this ship deserves to go dark?”

Go dark. His words hit me like the coldest acid. 

“And what the hell does that even mean, Jackson? You’re just going to throw us into the Black like it’s... what—some mercy?” My chest rose and fell heavily even as I tried to keep my voice low, steady. “That's suicide.”

“No.” His voice dropped again, closer bordering something too fragile for him to hold much longer. “That’s the only mercy we have left.”

The room went quiet. Cold, motionless quiet. Even Anna's breathing seemed to pause in disbelief.

“You’re seriously proposing this?” I heard my voice, but it didn’t sound like mine—raw, edged with something I couldn’t quite dissect. My fingers ached against the pressure of the table. “You’re giving up?”

Jackson ran one rough hand down his face slowly, weighed again by something I couldn’t even hate him for. His lips trembled faintly before he spoke. “I’m tired of them screaming,” he said finally, and he wasn’t looking at me anymore. “The ones trapped in the walls. The systems. They’re already dead, Kai. We're not saving anyone anymore by pretending to fight.”

“And us?” My voice struck harder, shaking now. “What about the rest of us, Jackson? Those... still breathing?” My throat felt raw now. “What happens when we let this ship fall? You think you’re saving lives?”

He didn’t answer. Maybe he couldn’t.

Anna shifted, the slight motion dragging my gaze for just a moment. There was a flicker—there, in her eyes, cold again. But no amusement or quick rebuttal came from her now. Only silence.

“I’m not going into the goddamn void just because you’ve lost hope,” I hissed, forcing the words from somewhere deep. They felt hollow the moment they left my mouth, the weight around us telling me they were already useless.

Jackson dropped his head slightly, no longer trying to hold me in his glare. Finally, he spoke. “You think I haven’t already lost everything?”

The silence didn’t break into argument after that. It just grew.




The corridors stretched before me, narrow and unkind, like veins coursing through the body of some dying beast. The fluorescent lights above buzzed unevenly, casting faint, greenish halos over warped metal walls. Most of the fixtures flickered erratically, threatening constantly to plunge everything into deeper shadow. My boots crunched over debris—scarred panels torn loose from the ship’s last violent tremor, shards of glass, and remnants of machinery that had outlasted its usefulness. The broken world clattered softly at my every step as I moved toward the sleep pods, the faint sway of the ship’s failing artificial gravity pulling everything just slightly off-center.

I had heard it groaning softly for hours now. The ship. The IAS-7 had always been dying—its death sentence lingering in every mechanical twitch, every unsteady groan—but it felt worse tonight. Compounded. Amplified, maybe, by the heavy silence from the crew. Or perhaps it was the other way around, like the ship’s pain wasn’t just decay, but something alive. Sentient.

I shook the thought off as quickly as it rose. The cold edge of the wrench in my hand grounded me, though the tendons in my wrist throbbed from holding it too long. I transferred the weight to my other hand and flexed my aching fingers. I was pushing uphill tonight—against fear, exhaustion, and the rusting, withering mass of the IAS-7 herself.

The walls creaked behind me. Just expansion from the temperature shift, I told myself for the fifth time. Nothing more.

It wasn’t convincing anymore.

The lights stuttered badly as I turned the next corner. My shadow twisted jaggedly against the jagged walls, contorting in bursts with every shudder of the ship. My throat was raw, either from shouting or the caustic stench that hung in the corridors—I wasn’t sure which. I didn’t take a full breath. You couldn’t, not here. The air tasted like burnt wires and rust.

To my left, a shredded bulkhead gaped open, exposing tangled wires that writhed faintly like severed nerves. I hurried past it. I wasn’t in the mood to see if it was moving or if my mind was twisting shadows into threats again. I wasn’t in the mood for much of anything. Just get to the pod. Close the hatch behind me. Forget.

The whispers started far too softly at first. Little eddies in the crumbling edge of consciousness, like wind slipping through broken glass. Only I knew better. There was no wind here. No air beyond the ship’s thin, recycled supply. 

At first, I thought I’d imagined them—just an auditory smear, a nervous tic from too many nights without sleep—but the sound grew. Faintly layered, rising and fading like the ebb of an unnatural tide. Words I couldn’t make out but could almost feel, scraping faintly at the edges of my skull. I stopped walking, wrench raised slightly, scanning the bad lighting and the worse shadows.

Nothing.

A long breath hissed through my clenched teeth as I forced myself to move again. Step. Step. I counted them, shallow and uneven against the debris-laden floor. My pace quickened. I wanted the pod now, more than I could admit. 

I almost made it.


The corridor leading to the sleep pods was the worst of them. The walls sagged inward at uneven angles, their metal scorched and puckered from when the fires reached this far. Most of the lights were out, leaving only the weak glow of my handheld torch to show the way. It flickered over the derelict remains—warped pieces of piping, a shattered emergency panel, skeletal frames of some machines that hadn’t been touched since the last attack. And somewhere above it all, the faintest rattle of movement.

I froze. The light from the torch bobbed slightly in synchronization with the rapid jump of my pulse. The sound was subtle—a scrape, maybe, or the shift of material just out of sight. My eyes flickered upward instinctively, staring at the scorched ductwork crisscrossing the ceiling. Nothing moved there, but the dim glow from my torch barely touched the edges of the overhead bulkhead. Too much shadow. 

“Don’t,” I whispered to myself, barely an exhale. “Not tonight.”

I should’ve kept walking. I took one hesitant step forward, and the rattle stopped abruptly. The stop was worse than the sound. My skin prickled cold, a shiver rolling from my scalp down the lengths of my arms as I turned my gaze again to the ceiling. At first, there was nothing. Then I saw it.

A drip. 

Thick and black, viscous as oil, it hung suspended from an overhead pipe, trembling faintly before falling and splattering onto the wrecked floor. My stomach twisted. Every instinct in me screamed to back away—to run—but my legs didn’t get the message. I stayed rooted, caught between dread and the impossibility of what I knew was coming. A faint hiss rose near my ear. Less sound. More sensation. Static, mechanical, but almost alive. I knew the presence above me before I saw it fully.

The Something emerged from the ceiling with a screech like nothing human. A grotesque, bristling mass of part-shadow, part-flesh, it writhed downward like its shape couldn’t decide what it wanted to be. Churning, gurgling—its surface was studded with fleshy nodules, slickened with glistening black ichor that dripped to the floor. It bled wrong. The dripping fluid hissed sharply as it touched metal, eating hungrily into the warped floor panels. Eyes—no, not eyes, but wrong, darker voids—shifted in and out of its pulsating mass, briefly taking shape before dissolving again into chaos. 

I stumbled backward out of instinct, my wrench clattering softly against the corridor wall as it knocked loose from my tightening grip. The sound seemed unthinkably loud. The creature shifted toward me, piece by writhing piece. It didn’t move like it walked, or like it crawled—like dragging shadow from a nightmare rendered physical. Its body stretched unnaturally, curling its churning mass toward me. And at its core: the sound. A deep, guttural chittering, layered with whispers laced like poison. Familiar words folded in there somewhere, but meaningless. I swallowed hard and darted back several more feet. Panic overtook expertise.

My hands fumbled desperately at my belt for the plasma cutter—my only weapon and barely that. The Something’s density shifted, a part of it peeling unnaturally across the adjacent wall, dripping corrupted flesh across the panels. My thumb found the cutter’s ignition more by luck than skill. A frantic burst of weak green plasma flared to life at the end of the tool, flickering against the poor wiring holding the thing together. Not much. Not enough.

The creature surged suddenly, its dripping appendage slamming into the corridor wall beside me. The sheer force rattled the ship’s structure, and the metal where it touched began twisting and blooming—alien textures spreading outward, the skeletal remains of the wall giving way to something organic, porous, alive. I gasped and scrambled aside, swinging the plasma arc desperately, connecting.

The light of the torch seared against the edge of its mass. The creature hissed—no, screamed—and recoiled tightly inward, its surface steaming as if burned. I saw my chance and ran, my legs pushing against every ounce of gravity the ship dared hold steady beneath me.


By the time I reached my pod, I barely remembered how I got there. My hands shook uncontrollably as I slammed the hatch shut and threw the internal lever into place. The faint blue emergency lights inside my pod flickered uneasily, bathing the small enclosure with a pale, hesitantly stable glow. My head hit the molded edge of the wall behind me as I slumped downward. My chest heaved, my breathing shallow and ragged. Shirt soaked. Arms trembling. The wrench and cutter tumbled uselessly out of my hands, clattering against the inside casing of the module. I didn't bother reaching.

Closing my eyes didn’t help. That was almost laughable. Every time they shut, the thing was still there—bristling, wrong, waiting.

I felt the hardened scrap of paper beneath my hand before I realized I’d even reached for it. Thin, brittle—folded neatly until I’d creased it to useless ruin over years of worry and retreat. The butterfly I’d once drawn stared faintly back at me in imperfect lines and faded graphite. It looked fragile in the flickering lights, more like a dream than memory—more like nothing.

I held onto it anyway and let the world go dark around me.



The cold hung heavy, even in sleep. I don’t remember dreaming, though something bitter lingered in my throat as I woke, my heart shuddering out of sync with the distant, bone-deep hum of the ship. My left hand was still clenched around the brittle scrap of paper, crumpling its fragile edges. The second I became conscious of it, I released the thing like it was burning me, and it fluttered down to my side. The air felt sharper. Wrong again.

Then the alarms hit.

A sudden blast of shrill, mechanical whine erupted around me, slamming me into the remains of my senses. My body jerked upright, a reflex older than most of my bones, and my head cracked against the top casing of the pod. The recycled air raked against my lungs as I forced a shaky breath, every cell screaming wake up, wake up, wake up.

Alarms meant two things: something had breached that shouldn’t have, or something worse was coming. My gut clenched before my brain caught up.

It wasn’t dark in my pod anymore. The emergency lights around the seams of the hatch pulsed red, like veins pumped full of panic. Then came the mechanical voice, crackling through the announcement feed in tinny monotone.

“Shield output compromised. Reactor systems at 23 percent. Maintenance override required. Repeat—shield output compromised.”

Maintenance override. My job. I didn’t have the luxury of letting the sound of all those syllables digest. I swung my legs downward and yanked myself toward the panel on the wall.

The pod’s hatch felt heavier than usual as my hand mashed the release switch, the panel releasing reluctantly with a pneumatic hiss. The faint chill of the outer corridor seeped in before I even stepped through, pinching the sweat against my skin, and I swallowed against the rising nausea threatening to claw its way up from my stomach.

The wrench was where I’d dropped it. I scooped it up instinctively as I stumbled toward the main maintenance consoles farther down the corridor, each step too heavy, my legs still dragging behind the rush of adrenaline storming through my veins. Somewhere deep within the ship, the metallic groan rumbled again, echoing off its skeletal framework like something intentional. 

I didn’t stop moving. 


The maintenance console loomed ahead, blinking furiously through its alerts—a makeshift mess of exposed wires and long-suffering screens bolted into the bulkhead ages ago. Where most of the ship’s systems were falling apart, this one was kept alive on life support: my labor, my patchwork repairs hastily built to stave off yet another calamity. 

“Don’t do this to me now,” I muttered under my breath, pressing one hand hard against the console frame for balance as the alarms screamed over my head. My fingers flew across the display, navigating emergency bypass codes with a familiarity born of necessity, not expertise. The static-riddled schematics hiccupped on-screen as the logs updated themselves painfully, the block-text information scrambling apart, then stitching back together into something still partially unreadable. 

Reactor systems stabilizing. External shielding still below threshold. Hull integrity at 62 percent. 

Not good. Not enough. 

I adjusted a few more parameters manually, rerouting limited power through the remaining functional conduits and patching over the worst gaps in the shielding matrix. My mind raced ahead of the commands I gave the machine—what was setting off the shields this time? Another attack? Had they broken through? My eyes darted toward the external feeds displayed on the corner-most screen, its fuzzy signal stumbling over fragmented images of the outer hull. Black on black. The infinite void. And... traces of something I couldn’t quite resolve. 

But then the display shrieked.

A new signal jutted rudely across the screens, scrambling every bit of data I’d been struggling with. A distorted burst of audio blistered through the console’s speakers, cutting through the alarms like the sharpened edge of chaos. I swore under my breath. The system struggled to make sense of the noise, bits of garbled static that somehow rearranged themselves—not into silence, not into nothingness, but into something worse. A voice.

“—IAS-7... Can anyone hear me? Please respond.”

The teeth in my jaw locked so hard I nearly chipped them. The static wove itself into shards again, words splintered by distortion and desperation, but unmistakably human. I scrambled to isolate the channel, hands jittering against the keypad to clean its remaining layers of interference.

“This is the Dreamer,” the voice came again, clearer this time. “We’ve been... breached. Someone... Please...” The transmission hissed and crackled. "This ship is not surviving."

I froze. That wasn’t just any voice. It was Anna. Her words climbed through the speakers and into my chest, where they coiled, twisting faint memories into something dangerously sharp—warm hazel eyes, hollow, guarded truths. Anna. Here. Now.

Before I could stop myself, I spoke into the comm in a voice that wasn’t confident, wasn’t composed—but something daggery and raw. “You’re transmitting on an unauthorized frequency. State your location.”

“Kai,” she gasped, the sound of her saying my name sending a wave of something too close to relief downshift into cold distrust. “I—oh God—Kai, you’re alive?”

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t yet.

“We need docking clearance.” Her voice frayed against its edges, something frantic breaking through. “The Dreamer—they’ve already overwhelmed most decks. We're losing everyone. There's—there's no one else. Your ship—it's the only reachable port. Please. I’m transmitting my coordinates.”

My heart thundered painfully against my ribs as her words fell into the thick air between us. I crouched lower against the console, studying the incoming signal with suspicion sharper than the cutter on my belt. The IAS-7 hadn’t detected another vessel until now, but there she was—the Dreamer—a speck of noise pinging faintly just outside the ship’s functional radar sweep. Sliding in barely close enough for contact.

The Somethings had to be involved. They were always involved. Doubt needled its way through every corner of my thoughts. 
This was a trap. It had to be. 

“Why now?” I said suddenly, my voice clawing back its edge. “How the hell do I know you’re not compromised, Anna? If you’re alive—”

Her voice broke something jagged through mine. “I wouldn’t have called unless there was no other option,” she said, sharper than I remembered, and just as unsettling. “You know me, Kai. You know this isn’t a trick.”

“Do I?” My question was water across coals—soft, but enough. 

The line hissed again with its static. For a split second, I considered cutting the transmission there—throwing her words into the emptiness and walking away. But then she said something else, her voice trembling but steady enough to find me through the suffocating metal that was the IAS-7 now.

“If you don’t let us dock,” she said, and her tone burned, “then I guarantee you—whatever killed us will find you next. There’s no out if we’re gone. The Dreamer isn’t asking. I'm asking.”

Silence clamped down. Harder than I was ready for.

Before I’d even realized I was doing it, my fingers brushed the controls to unlock the docking codes. I hesitated just a half-breath before pressing the final confirmation. The hollow noise of the transmission sealed itself away, and Anna's voice disappeared into whatever space she’d come from. The Dreamer would dock.

I didn’t allow myself the depth to process the decision. Didn’t let myself wonder what I might just have let inside. I straightened to step away from the console when I saw it.

A faint presence moved at the edge of my peripheral vision—so fast, so slight I almost didn’t catch it. Instinctively, I spun around, wrench up in one shaking hand. 

Nothing.

But the darkness felt... thicker now.



The Dreamer docked with the IAS-7 like a corpse propped against the door—slow, reluctant, and impossibly wrong. I felt the vibration through the hollows of the ship before I saw anything, a low tremor stretching outward from where the airlock seals engaged. My arms tensed involuntarily, fingers tightening on the wrench like it might make a difference. Even here, by the reinforced hull of the airlock, the Something’s texture had bled into the ship—unnatural growths twisting out of the walls in faint, fibrous patterns. They pulsed faintly when the docking clamps hissed into place.

I stayed rooted in the corridor, staring at the airlock hatch as it groaned reluctantly, a mechanical sigh that made the metal seam under my boots feel thinner. My other hand hovered near the cutter looped at my belt, thumb already grazing its ignition switch. I told myself it was precaution and not panic.

The inner door slid open first, flooding the waiting corridor with thin, bitterly cold air from the other side. I grimaced, the metallic stink catching sharp in my nostrils, and stepped back instinctively. Then, the hiss of the outer lock, and she emerged.

Anna.

She stepped forward slowly, the folds of her tattered jumpsuit clinging to her slight frame. Her boots crunched on the rust-scattered grating as she lurched across the threshold. For a moment, she just stood there, framed by the glowing red strip above the airlock. She looked human. Exhausted—and haunted beneath the short cut of her black hair—but human.

“God,” she murmured, her voice cracking in the silence. Her first breath caught hard, like even the air hurt her. “I didn’t... I wasn’t sure this was real. I thought maybe—”

“Step forward.” My own voice startled me, sharper than I intended. I didn’t lower the wrench. “One step. Hands up.”

Her hazel eyes flicked toward me, catching just enough light to glint faintly. For one terrible second, something in their depth almost looked like movement. But then she raised her hands—slowly, palms up—and the moment passed. 

“It’s me, Kai,” she said softly. “I’m not... Please. It’s me.”

She sounded like Anna. Almost exactly. But everything aboard the Dreamer—hell, everything aboard the IAS-7—had a way of clawing at truths until they broke. I lowered the wrench halfway but stayed tense, watching her for shadow-thin cracks in her shape, texture, or movements—anything wrong.

“Prove it,” I said. My pulse kicked hard against the side of my ribs. “How do I know you’re not... one of them?”

Her shoulders slumped faintly, but her expression didn’t crack. She stepped carefully closer, the faint hum of the ship framing her voice in the distance.

“How do I prove something like that?” she asked, her tone steady enough to disarm me, though she still held her hands up. “What do you want, Kai? A blood sample? A confession? You know this thing we’re fighting doesn’t work like that.”

“That’s my point,” I said, but my grip on the wrench slackened just slightly. “You could be—contaminated. I’ve seen it happen. Turned on us before we even knew what—”

“I’m here,” she said bluntly, cutting me off with a harsh edge of resolve. Her voice dropped quieter. “I’m still here.”

I didn’t know if I believed her, not entirely, but I was still standing. Still breathing. Despite everything vibrating around us, she was here, in front of me, and those faint gestures of hers—the slight tilt of her head, the careful tightness in her posture—cut jagged holes through logic. They scraped at memory.

I lowered the wrench another inch. Something inside me wanted to hate her for how much that shred of familiarity mattered—how much it hurt.

“What happened on the Dreamer?” I asked instead, shifting slightly as I watched her. I needed to know what the hell I’d just let inside my ship.

Her hands fell slowly to her sides, deliberate and smooth, before her shoulders sank further. She leaned slightly against the frame of the airlock, her hands brushing the bulked texture there. For a moment, she looked seconds from collapse, her expression grim and raw.

“It started in the lower decks,” she said, barely above a whisper. Her arms folded tightly across herself, her voice steadying only because she forced it to. “First, it was the equipment. Little things. Corrupt wiring—short-circuited systems. And then it wasn’t. Then it was the crew.”

My jaw tightened, my voice cutting in over hers. “How bad?”

“No one’s left. Not... the way they should be.” Her voice wavered but cleared after a moment. “When they moved first, it was just one... one instance in the dark. But it didn’t take long. Maybe a day. They overwhelmed the life-support systems while we were focused on containment.”

Her words spiraled downward into cold slamming silence. I didn’t fill it. My knuckles whitened against the wrench, every piece of her story greasing the cold instinct crawling up the back of my neck. The Somethings had gotten to her, gotten into her ship. It explained the exhaustion, the slow collapse stitched into her movements—but dammit, the look in her eyes was still there. The warmth I remembered flickered, faint but intact.

Everything about her should have screamed don’t trust this. It didn’t.

Instead, without meaning to, I found myself asking the wrong question. “How did you get out?”

Her faint, bitter smile reached me before her words did. “I didn’t,” she said, the sorrow in her tone biting hard. After a breath, she continued: “I fought. I used containment strategies I haven’t had to think about in years. It got us... this far. Too far.”

I almost said something back but couldn’t. Couldn’t find it.

“So?” Her voice had softened slightly. “What’s this new thing now, Kai? You going to interrogate me here all night, or are we moving for what’s left of your crew?”

Her change in tone threw me—snapped me back to the hollow grip of reality. I adjusted my stance sharply, falling into step as I began walking. The wrench swung back to my side, and she followed close, pulling the airlock tight behind her. The hyper-pressurized seal clicked faintly into place, and I hated how final it sounded.

“Jackson,” I said after a long walk started replacing small silence. “We have to stop him. If he severs the outer connections—”

“—he’ll strand you,” Anna finished, her tone dark. “I figured. You’ve got your practical types. They try to save the lives they know when everything else collapses.”

Her comment lingered uncomfortably. She matched pace beside me perfectly, a quiet, eerie command exuding from how efficiently she moved despite herself.

When her eyes caught the seam of my toolbelt strap, it came with a slow, attentive focus.

“That,” she said carefully, her voice fainter but tugging enough—just enough of me to look at her. “That drawing there.” 

My hand moved without thought; I realized the butterfly drawing rested half-stuffed against the looped seam. I never meant for it to show.

“Just... something,” I said quickly, brushing the thing too awkwardly into pocket obscurity. I expected her to move in-demand harder. Instead, for her hesitation measured out-compassion somehow anything tightening from me or her softly find became juxtaposed clearer meant heavier softer until forced-chaotic breath trailed-on.

“It mattered to you, then still does?”



The drawing stayed in my pocket, crumpled but present, as Anna and I walked deeper into the gutted belly of the IAS-7. She hadn’t pressed further about it—hadn’t needed to. Her comment still lingered, sinking roots into the fragile soil of my mind where too much was already clawing to take hold. The faint sounds of the ship breathing—groaning, humming its incessant, unnatural hymn—filled the silence in our wake. It drowned the quiet rhythm of my breathing in broken, uneven notes.

The corridor stretched ahead, narrowing as we moved farther from the docking shaft. The air thinned with the temperature, sharper now, colder than it had any right to be. Every step felt like stepping into a tomb not yet sealed, the vibration of the Dreamer’s docking still radiating faintly through the grating beneath my boots. The Somethings’ fingerprints clung to everything—the faint pulsing growths along the crumpled walls, the oily sheen in corners where the emergency lights cast their sickly red glow. The walls themselves weren’t right anymore. They bulged in unnatural places, exhaling faint whispers like lungs brought back wrong.

I adjusted the grip on my wrench, my palm slick against its worn handle. My thumb brushed against its grooves, grounding myself in its cold, mechanical simplicity. That was when I heard it.

The song.

Faint at first, just at the edge of hearing. A dissonant hum threading through the distant hum of the ship—a melodic wrongness that didn’t match the IAS-7 or anything made by human hands. I froze, instinctively reaching out to stop Anna beside me. She halted mid-step, her fingers curling back where they hovered near her chest. Her breath escaped in a faint, visible cloud against the bitter chill. Her hazel eyes locked on me.

“Do you hear that?” My voice came quieter than I intended, like I was afraid saying it too loud would make it real.

She nodded slowly, her expression unreadable. “It’s been—there, since the Dreamer,” she murmured, her voice deliberate but soft. “It got louder when they came.”

The Somethings. Of course. I shifted where I stood, trying to zero in on the sound’s source. It ebbed and flowed through the corridor like a current, pulling with it the ship’s tension, its faint tremors. My stomach twisted, the nausea spiking momentarily before settling into an all-too-familiar knot.

“It’s close,” I said through a tight jaw, my voice balancing barely above a whisper. “And it’s watching.”

Anna’s lips pressed thin, her sharp features hardening against the soft red glow of the corridor’s lights. The faintest flicker of unease cracked through her steely front—a flicker I hadn’t seen in her before. Her stare broke away from me, scanning the bulkheads with small, practiced movements. She’d seen this before. She was fighting to compartmentalize something even I didn’t know yet.

Still, she turned back to me and stepped closer, her voice steadying.

“Then we keep moving. Jackson isn’t going to wait.”

I nodded, swallowing the tightness in my throat. She was right—if Jackson went through with it, severing what was left of the IAS-7’s core systems, then this would become a graveyard buried in vacuum. None of us would survive that. 

We walked.

The sound followed.

It wove through the silence like a razor dragged across metal, growing in faint, layered harmonics, each one more grating than the last. My pulse quickened with every step—every metallic thud from my boots against the grated floor lining the corridor. The Somethings were here, their presence thickening the air like the fibrous growths bristling along the bulkheads.

They never revealed themselves outright. They didn’t need to. The shifting shadows at the edges of vision were enough—the way they moved, slow and deliberate, always parallel to us but never intersecting. Once, I thought I saw an arm, or maybe a tendril—something wet and misshapen dragging itself along the floor for half a second before slipping out of sight. My skin crawled, but I kept walking. I kept telling myself we were faster than them. Or smarter. Or at least more desperate.

Beside me, Anna kept pace, but her breathing was shallower now. I caught brief flickers of her face in the pale, intermittent emergency lights—her gaze distant, her brow furrowed. She was hiding something, but her mask was starting to splinter under the weight of this place. It made me want to ask her if she was okay.

I didn’t.

The air tightened the closer we got to the core. The hallway narrowed further, the walls themselves warping inward as if the structure of the ship was folding under pressure. Every impact of my boots against the grating resounded louder, the noise falling into the song’s rhythm like notes striking in disarray. It wasn’t just sound anymore—it was vibration, a resonance threading through the ship’s dying bones and into mine.

We rounded the next corner. And then I saw it.

A person—or what remained of one. Twisted. Mutilated. They were fused to the bulkhead like an extrusion of the metal itself, their torso a broken latticework of sinew and steel. Black ooze dripped from the seams where flesh and machine met, pooling against tattered scraps of uniform that clung uselessly to what had once been a body. Their head hung low, chin against warped ribs, before snapping up with a sickening crack.

Eyes. One human, drowning in desperation. The other a black, viscous void that roiled faintly like a living thing in its socket.

“Don’t—” The sound escaped their mouth as a wet, hoarse gasp. They gargled faintly before choking the words into something intelligible. “Don’t go closer. Don’t—please.”

I froze. Anna did too. The song pulsed louder, its tones heightening in warbled discordant intervals like it knew. Knew we were here. Knew we’d come too far now to turn back. My fingers tightened instinctively around the wrench, its cold weight keeping me tethered.

The mangled crewmember managed to speak again, spitting syllables between shallow, wet breaths.

“It... doesn’t end. It doesn’t let go.”

They shuddered violently, their twisted frame convulsing against exposed wires embedded in the bulkhead. The black ooze at the corner of their lips turned crimson, and it took me a second longer than it should have to realize they were crying. They broke again into a breathless plea.

“Turn back. It’ll—take you too.”

I felt the weight of Anna’s stare before she spoke.

“They’re gone, Kai,” she said evenly, her tone a forced calm. “The person—what they were—it’s...”

“I can see that,” I said sharply, though my voice cracked into something softer halfway through. I didn’t take my eyes off the thing in front of me.

The whimpering slowed, fading into faint shudders as what was left of the crewmember turned limp against the bulkhead. The metal around them pulsed faintly, matching the rhythm of the shadows weaving along the walls behind us. My throat tightened, indecision clawing at my gut. There was nothing I could do for them—nothing except honor their warning. And yet—

“Kai.” Anna’s voice shifted, sharper but quieter. “We have to go. Now.”

She stepped closer, her presence gravity against my hesitation. Her eyes locked on mine, studying me not with judgment, but with something colder. She didn’t look back at the thing on the wall. Neither did I.

I exhaled tightly and stepped forward.



The doorway to the power core loomed ahead, its edges flickering faintly with distorted light. The air here was heavy, clinging to my lungs like oil, drowning every step in a suffocating, metallic haze. The song was louder now—throbbing, insidious, a cacophony threading itself into the marrow of the ship. The corridors behind us felt like they were closing in, folding under the weight of whatever infection was spreading through the IAS-7’s veins.

“Keep close,” I said, though my voice barely sounded like my own. It dragged behind me, brittle and hollow. I didn’t look back at Anna, but I heard her steps, steady and deliberate, falling into sync with mine. Her presence moved with an uncanny rhythm—a rhythm I deliberately ignored to keep moving.

The door shuddered faintly as I reached it, my wrench slipping slightly in my grip as I raised it to brush the control panel. The shock of static against my palm caught me off guard, stinging enough to make my hand jerk back. The song pulsed louder for just an instant, as if it had been waiting for me to touch the metal. My breath hitched, but I pressed harder on the panel until the door heaved open with a strained, mechanical groan.

Inside, the core glowed weakly—a sickly, uneven light cast from the tangle of exposed wiring that spiraled upward toward the ceiling like diseased veins. The containment casing had been stripped away; black, viscous fluid dripped from metal conduits warped to unnatural angles. The walls were slick, pulsing faintly in time with the rhythm of the ship, as if they were breathing.

And there, at the heart of it all, stood Jackson.

But it wasn’t Jackson anymore.

At first, I didn’t recognize him. His bulked form blended into the shifting mass of cables and ooze, until he shifted, and the faint flicker of his hazel eyes caught mine. Or... eye. The other had dissolved into a deep socket of writhing black mass, exuding tendrils that burrowed into the cables around him like parasitic roots. His flesh sagged and bristled with lesions, patches of what looked like corroded metal embedded in his skin. His mouth was twisted, stretched too wide, as if fighting to form a shape it had long since forgotten.

He turned toward me with a motion that felt too fragmented to be human, his gaze locking hard onto mine. For a moment, I almost called his name—but the sound stuck in my throat. The last shreds of familiarity evaporated as he stepped forward, his gait jerking like a marionette controlled by quivering strings.

“Kai...” His voice was a ragged whisper, scraping against my ears like broken glass grinding across steel. “You shouldn’t have—”

He shuddered violently, coughing up a stream of black ooze that hissed when it splattered against the floor. His body spasmed, doubling over, before snapping back upright with a grotesque crack of his spine.

“You shouldn’t have come.”

I braced myself, stepping closer but keeping my distance, the wrench feeling heavier by the second in my hand. Jackson—or whatever was left of him—trembled, his hands gripping the cables around him for support. Or maybe to cling to what little control he still had.

“Jackson,” I said carefully. My voice sounded steadier than I felt. “What are you doing? We can—maybe we can fix this. You just need to step away.”

His laugh was an awful, wet noise, choking on itself as he held his head at an impossible angle. The shadows around him seemed to warp, twisting with each vibration of the song that now felt like it was inside my head, scraping at the inside of my skull.

“Fix?” he hissed, his teeth flashing briefly in an unnatural grimace. “There’s nothing to fix, Kai. It doesn’t stop. It doesn’t stop.”

He slammed a hand into the wires nearest him, and they pulsed violently in response, sending a shudder that rippled outward through the room. “You think you can stand here and fight this? You think it’ll let you?”

I took another step closer, my grip tightening on the wrench until my knuckles ached. My heart hammered against my ribs, but I forced my voice through the rising nausea.

“We’ve survived this long,” I said. “We’ll find a way. But not if you—if you give in to it. Whatever it is.”

Jackson’s mangled face twisted into something else—a grin, or maybe something meant to resemble one.

“It’s too late,” he rasped. “For me. For you. For all of us.”

Then he lunged.

It happened so fast, I barely had time to react. His body moved with horrifying speed, launching itself across the room with a strength that defied anything human. He slammed into me, his clawed hands tearing at my shoulder as we hit the grating hard. Pain arced through my arm, and I gasped, twisting beneath his weight and swinging the wrench blindly into his side. The impact made a sickening crunch, and he reared back, but the blow didn’t seem to slow him. If anything, it made him stronger.

His form rippled, flesh boiling into something grotesque. Tendrils erupted from his torso, curling around my arm, and I screamed, igniting the cutter at my belt and slashing wildly. The blade burned through the tendrils, severing them with sparks and smoke, but more emerged, writhing and snapping like living things. 

Jackson’s voice shrieked in layers—not just his, but voices that weren’t his, voices that didn’t belong, bleeding into my ears with an intensity that made me stumble to my knees.

And then, from behind him, Anna’s voice cut through the madness.

“Enough.”

I turned toward her, my vision blurred, just in time to see her step forward. But she wasn’t Anna—not anymore.

Her body convulsed, and her features shifted like liquid melting away from a mold. Her skin—once warm and human—sloughed off in pieces, revealing something darker, something unnatural. Tendrils emerged from her spine, coiling with purpose, her limbs elongating into impossible angles. Her hazel eyes burned away, replaced by glowing voids that stared into me, through me.

Jackson twisted toward her, his tendrils trembling visibly. He let out a guttural snarl, but before he could react, Anna—no, the thing she had become—lashed out. Her tendrils wrapped around his mutated form, coiling tighter and tighter as Jackson screamed, the sound splintering into a noise so unbearable it made my ears bleed.

She consumed him.

The process was violent, grotesque. Black ooze and crimson light filled the air as her body tore into his, devouring him piece by piece. His screams drowned beneath the wet, ripping sound of sinew being pulled apart until there was nothing left of him but scattered remnants—pieces too twisted to even recognize as human. The air was thick with the stench of decay and what might have been metal burning.

And then she turned to me.

I froze, every muscle locking into place as her form loomed closer. The song swelled, louder and louder, until it felt like it was going to tear me apart from the inside. Her gaze fixed on mine, her voice reaching me—not as words, but as a layered cacophony that reverberated through my skull.

“You should never have trusted me.”

She moved closer, her presence suffocating, her tendrils inching toward me with slow, deliberate intent. My hand tightened on the cutter, blood dripping from my arm, but I couldn’t bring myself to lift it. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe.

The world around me collapsed into sound and shadow, and I realized, too late, that I had never stood a chance.




Her shadow loomed over me, impossibly tall, impossibly wrong, as the song rose in crescendo. It wasn’t just sound anymore; it was inside my skull, gnawing behind my eyes, threading itself through the marrow of my bones. Her searing, void-like gaze bore into mine, and for that moment, I could think of nothing but the gaping inevitability of her words.

"You should never have trusted me."

I couldn’t move. My pulse hammered, reverberating violently in my chest—trapped, like everything else. My hand gripped the cutter, slick with blood and sweat, but I didn’t raise it. What would be the point? She wasn’t Anna anymore. She wasn’t anyone anymore. I was staring into something that should not exist, and existence itself seemed to be peeling away in her presence.

The world around us twisted, folding over itself like heat-warped metal. The walls of the core vibrated, faint pulses rippling like liquid in their grotesque, lung-like rhythm. The scent of scorched wiring mingled with the putrid stench of black ooze, turning my stomach until bile threatened to rise. I inhaled shallowly through clenched teeth, fighting to stay upright, to stay present, to stay human.

And then I heard it—or, rather, felt it.  

A faint scraping. Behind me.  

Something dragging itself across the grated floor, faint but deliberate, like broken metal scratching over steel. It came in uneven bursts, halting with stops and starts before continuing its pitiful crawl toward me. I didn’t dare turn my eyes from Anna—no, the husk of what Anna had become—but the sound clawed at my attention like nails raking over raw flesh.

The dragging grew louder, closer. And then, to my absolute horror, it reached me.

A weight bumped into my side—wet, heavy, and wrong. My breath stuttered as I dared to look down.  

It was a hand. A severed hand. Jackson’s hand.  

No, both of them.

They were charred, battered, and blackened around the wrists, yet somehow, impossibly, they still moved. Tendons quivered faintly beneath blistered skin, fingers curling and uncurling as though seeking something just out of reach. Between them, clasped in trembling digits that had no business holding anything anymore, was a battered notebook. Its cover, smeared with blood and unidentifiable viscera, still bore faint outlines of Jackson’s handwriting—a name, perhaps, too faint to fully read.

I swallowed hard, my throat raw against the tight grip of fear.  

"What the hell..." The words trembled out before I could stop them, barely audible over the oppressive hum of the song.

The hands crawled closer, nudging the notebook against me. The movement was slow but insistent, like something from a fever dream too grotesque and nonsensical to believe. My stomach churned, and I would’ve screamed if my lungs weren’t frozen solid.

Behind me, Anna—or the thing that wore her skin—did not move. She stood utterly still, observing, as if testing me. Her void-like gaze shifted faintly, flicking down toward the hands, then back to me. A silent watcher. A judge.

I didn’t want to touch it. Whatever was left of Jackson, of his soul, of his humanity, wasn’t in those hands. I knew that. I knew it. But they kept pushing that damned notebook at me, forcing it closer and closer until the cracked leather edges dug into my bloody knee.

So I grabbed it.  

Not out of courage. Not out of curiosity. But because I couldn’t bear to face something so determined to reach me and deny it whatever peace it was seeking. It was something primal—a reflex, carved into my psyche by years of looking for glimmers of life in the dark corridors of death.

My fingers closed around the drenched cover.  

It was cold. Colder than anything in that room had any right to be, but that didn’t stop me. The hands stilled as soon as I took the book. They trembled once, twice, and then fell lifeless to the floor with a wet crack! Whatever force had animated them was gone. It was just me and that damned notebook now.

I flipped it open.  

The pages were warped, sticking together in clumps, but I forced them apart with fingers that shook from adrenaline and the frigid slime smearing between the paper. Jackson’s notes filled the margins, his handwriting shaky and uneven, with entire entries scribbled out until the ink bled into incomprehensible stains. 

But I kept going.  

And then, I saw it.

A crude, almost childlike drawing, scrawled in sweeping, uneven strokes of pencil. A butterfly. Smudged, warped, but unmistakably a butterfly.  

My breath hitched.  

The lines were shaky, the wings asymmetrical, but somehow—somehow—it was beautiful. Hauntingly beautiful, in the way that only something so desperately fragile could be. Jackson had promised me this once, didn’t he? During one of those rare quiet moments when the horrors hadn’t seemed so insurmountable—when his human soul had peeked out from under the shell of despair that weighed him down.  

"I’ll draw you something," he’d said, his gruff voice tinged with uncharacteristic gentleness. "Something... better than this. You’ll see."  

I hadn’t believed him.  

I’d forgotten.

But here it was.  

And suddenly, I understood.  

My breath came in shallow gasps, the air around me thickening until every inhale clawed at my lungs like glass shards. This wasn’t a symbol of escape. It wasn’t some beautiful dream meant to carry us away from the rot and filth of this sinking ship. No, it wasn’t about leaving.

It was about becoming.

The butterfly wasn’t a rejection of the decay—it was a reflection of it. A transformation. The universe, the IAS-7, us—we weren’t meant to last as we were. Jackson knew that. He’d fought it, tried to defy it, tried to stop it. But in the end, even he’d realized: the decay wasn’t the end.

It was the beginning.

And he’d left this for me. In the heart of all this madness, he’d given me something I hadn’t even realized I needed. A choice.  

Do I stop fighting? Do I let this thing, this force, define me? Or do I let it transform me into something else—something it can’t break?

A guttural sound tore me from my thoughts.  

Anna.

The thing she had become lunged.  

I staggered backward, clutching the notebook so tightly the pages threatened to shred. Her tendrils lashed out, snapping toward me like jagged extensions of the song still vibrating in my head. I ducked, rolled, the pain in my arm surging as she slammed into the grating just where I’d stood moments before.

Somewhere, through the panic, I understood: I wasn’t getting out of here. Not like this. Not... human.

But maybe that wasn’t the point anymore.

The butterfly buried itself in my mind, the crumpled notebook still trembling in my grip. A transformation. A reckoning.  

"I won't end like you!" I screamed at her—or at myself. Maybe both.

Her limbs curled unnaturally, her expression unreadable except for the void in her eyes that seemed to pulse in time with the song. The air vibrated with tension, her shadow growing larger, darker, enveloping. But as she came for me again, I clenched the notebook to my chest and moved forward with everything I had left. Forward, through the decay. Forward, through the wreckage of what we were.  

Toward whatever it was I was meant to become. 



The grip of Anna’s transformed shadow bore down on me, the weight of her presence stretching the walls of the power core far beyond their physical confines. My chest tightened as the song sank deeper into my head, spinning the room into a spiral of twisted sound and light. My legs trembled, barely holding me upright as the twisted melody bled into my every nerve, grinding away what little resilience I had left.

I stumbled back, still clutching the notebook against my chest, my mind screaming for clarity. The damned butterfly stared back at me, its crude, uneven wings almost daring me to understand. Through the haze of pain and despair, it came to me—not as some calculated plan, but as instinct clawing desperately at the frayed edges of my mind. The wires. Jackson’s plan. It had to mean something. It had to.

Anna—whatever she had become—twisted toward me, her void-like gaze locking onto my trembling form. Her tendrils slithered across the ruined floor, leaving jagged gouges in the grating as they writhed and snapped, each one imbued with an unnatural hunger.

"Kai," her voice came—a distorted amalgamation of tones, layered and wrong. It wasn’t Anna’s voice anymore; it was something vast and hollow, a sound like splintered glass scraping across the remnants of my sanity. "You can’t escape it. You are it."

I forced a breath—shallow, wheezing, but enough to keep me standing. My gaze darted toward the exposed wires snaking from the core’s center. They pulsed faintly, alive with the sickly rhythm that had infected the entire ship. The cables tangled like veins in a hemorrhaging wound, and at their heart, the pulsing nucleus blinked with diseased light. That... thing was the umbilical cord tying us to whatever lurked just beyond the ship’s decaying walls.

“No,” I rasped. My voice was raw, my throat shredded from the earlier screams. “You don’t get to decide how this ends. Not for me. Not for anyone left.”

She tilted her head, the motion slow and unnerving, like a marionette under frayed strings. Her lips curled back—no, stretched—into something too wide, too knowing. "Oh, Kai... you still think there’s an ending?"

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t afford to. My legs were moving before I could process the decision, carrying me toward the wires with reckless urgency. The wrench still hung at my side, its surface slick with grime and blood, but it felt heavier now—an anchor pulling me toward an inevitable choice. The notebook pressed against my ribs like a lifeline, its silent butterfly a quiet, desperate companion.

Her shriek ripped through the air as if sensing my intent. The sound was deafening, shattering what little concentration I had left as tendrils lashed out toward me. I threw myself forward, hitting the grating hard as one snapped just behind me, cutting through the air where my chest had been only seconds before. My knees hit the ground painfully, but I clawed my way forward, bloodied fingers grasping at the tangle of wires pulsing with corrupted life.

The ship thrummed violently beneath me, its metallic skeleton groaning under the strain. The Somethings were closing in—I couldn’t see them yet, but I felt them in the air, in the heat radiating from the walls as they warped and shimmered.

Another tendril lashed out, catching my already-wounded arm. Pain exploded as it cut deep into flesh, and I cried out, my vision swimming as I slashed blindly with the cutter gripped in my free hand. The blade ignited with a sharp hiss, slicing through the tendril. It recoiled with a sickening screech, leaving black ooze sizzling on the floor beside me.

“You’ll kill them all!” Anna’s voice rang out, the tones vibrating against my skull. "The crew—the hope—what little you’ve held onto. You can’t fight the song by silencing it!"

Her words stung; they found the cracks, the doubts I couldn’t shake. Was there anything left? Was I about to kill whatever scraps of life hadn’t yet fully succumbed? My fingers hesitated for one precious second, hovering above the first cluster of cables.

And then I heard it: faint, flickering whispers. Not Anna’s voice, not the Somethings—no, this was something else. Maybe it was Jackson, or what was left of him. Or maybe it was just my unraveling mind. But it wasn’t angry. It wasn’t cruel.

“You’ve come this far. Don’t stop now.”

I gritted my teeth, surged upward, and drove the wrench down into the first wire with everything I had. Sparks erupted, burning my skin and lighting the room with a brief, blistering glow. The ship shuddered violently, and the song faltered—briefly, but enough that I could hear the shrieking recoil of the Somethings in the distance.

Anna... the husk of Anna... shrieked, her shape warping and twisting into some new impossible configuration as she lunged for me, her tendrils clawing desperately across the space between us.

“NO!” she screamed, her voice layered with a thousand other voices. "Do you think the Black will save you? It will consume you! It will make you nothing!"

I ignored her, throwing my weight into the next bundle of cables. My arms strained, my body trembling with exhaustion as I ripped them apart. The core’s glow dimmed further, pulsing erratically as the connection faltered more and more.

The Somethings began to pour into the room, their shadow-flesh bodies spilling like ink through the open doorway. Their chittering screams scratched at my ears, at my sanity, but they faltered with every severed wire. Their forms shimmered and collapsed, unable to sustain themselves as the ship’s link to... whatever was undone.

One more. Just one more.

I reached for the primary cable, its throbbing mass alight with a sickly glow. Anna—or the creature controlling her—roared once more, hurling herself at me as her grotesque form unraveled fully into something unrecognizable. Her tendrils coiled tighter, her face splitting and reshaping into a void-like mass of mouths and eyes. Even now, she was still beautiful in some horrible, incomprehensible way—an embodiment of all I couldn’t understand.

But she was too late.

I wrapped both hands around the central cable and pulled. Hard.

It came loose with a deafening crack, and the room exploded with light—a blinding burst of white and red and black. The sound that followed was not a scream but an absence of sound, a void that swallowed the song and every resonance left within the ship. The Somethings shrieked one final time, their forms collapsing inward, consumed by the very emptiness that now engulfed the IAS-7.

I fell backward, hitting the grating hard. The notebook fell from my grasp, tumbling open onto the floor as the ship’s last vibrations dissipated beneath me. The world around me was quiet now—painfully, utterly quiet.

And then, I realized it wasn’t just the ship. The stars—it was as if they, too, had gone. No light filtered through the walls. No hum of distant mechanical life. The universe was gone.

Only the Black remained.

I sucked in a breath. For the first time in what felt like years, the air came easily, freely. It tasted cold, sharp and clean against the ache in my lungs. And in that silence, I let myself collapse onto my knees, the notebook lying open before me.

The butterfly stared back at me, its wings trembling faintly in the low, unnatural draft that crawled through the void. My blood dripped onto the pages, smudging the pencil lines, but the drawing still held its fragile beauty.

I placed a trembling hand against it. Not to wipe the blood away, but to let it stay. To let it become a part of it. The butterfly wasn’t perfect—not meant to be. It carried its scars, its asymmetry. But it was still something.

In the vast, crushing nothingness of the Black, I let myself believe that maybe—just maybe—something fragile, something beautiful, could still be created.  

Even here.
